            <p>Asks if a museum in Cambridge might be interested in purchasing North American mounted birds from an associate in Nova Scotia. Asks if JSH knows anyone with a collection of bird eggs for species comparison.</p>

                    <p>As M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Havell omitted to send you a copy of my second Vol. of Ornith. Biog. I do so and beg your acceptance of it, as a small tribute of all your kind attentions to me.</p>
                  <p>I see so very little of the world although in London, that I have not heard if you had been in town or not since last I had the pleasure of hearing from you; now four years since. Are you likely to come shortly? If so I beg that you will let us know where to find you.</p>
                  <p>My work is now progressing fast, having made every arrangement in my power to have it finished in the course of three years, having added Engravers and Colorers to our stock of workmen for this purpose. The 3rd Vol. of Biog. will be printed next Autumn, a few months in advance of the 3rd Vol. of "Birds of America" after which one more only will remain to be published. I am anxious to know from you if you have a Museum at Cambridge containing a collection of Mounted Birds, and in such a case should like to know if you wish to purchase North American specimens? M <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles MacCulloch from Pictou, in Nova Scotia, has a fine series of well mounted birds which he offers for sale, I believe on moderate terms, and I have bought some from him. He also has some insects from the same quarter and also some quadrupeds. Please also to tell me if any person of your acquaintance has a collection of Bird's Eggs; this I ask on my account, being anxious to publish those of our birds, and to compare such Europeans as belong to Species thought to be the same in America and England, which are mostly Water Birds.</p>
                  <p>Should you have any money on hand for me I will be glad to receive it at your convenience - and if I can be of any service to you here I pray you will not fear to send me your wishes. Accept my best wishes and regards, and believe me My Dear Sir your truly thankful friend</p>
