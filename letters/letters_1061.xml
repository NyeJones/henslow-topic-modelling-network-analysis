                  <p>I am very sorry to find you are not to be of our cragging party. My Son George will join us &amp; must do the ex-Captain for you, as he wears moustaches! Mr Cobbold, M.P. for Ipswich had invited us to dinner, but writes this morning to say he is obliged to be in town, &amp; must leave us to breakfast with Mrs C. as I had proposed to be early in Ipswich tomorrow, not to lose time. I find however the train does not reach Hadleigh before 7P.M. at this season, &amp; it would be too much to hurry Fisher off over early tomorrow - so we shall not get to Ipswich before 1.15 I shall go to Hadleigh on the chance of his coming by <hi rend="underline">that</hi> train, as I suppose he will - but I have not heard from him. I am delighted to hear that Hitcham is to be considered worthy imitation in Purbeck - &amp; if you want to take a lesson in Macguire Museum you must come here for the 11th. I dare say we can stow you in an attic, if best beds should be pre-occupied - &amp; I believe George's room will be vacant, as he means to return to Cambridge to reside there during the L.V. you might cream up a few Lecturets for a future occasion! I send by this post a few supplementary documents connected with the Hitcham Press. I see Hooker &amp; Arnott have just published a new edition which will probably necessitate some corrections in the numbers of the Genera &amp; then in the List sent. It is unlucky I did not wait a fortnight longer before printing it. Many thanks for yr Purbeck Insects. I feel sure <hi rend="underline">now</hi> that the Cambs species in Fisher's specimens are fragments of Insects (Beetles wings &amp; not vegetable. I am just on to be President of an Ipswich Natural History Club, in imitation of <hi rend="underline">you</hi> so we reciprocate. Have you seen what I have said about Cambridge prospects in Nat. Hist. in the account of Bell's address in the Lit. Gazette for June 17?</p>
                  <p>Yrs very truly</p>
