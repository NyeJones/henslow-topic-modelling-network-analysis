                        <p>I am confined to my room by a vile stupifying cold, &amp; at present good for nothing in the way of work. But I have been trying to answer some letters, which load my file. Yours of Octr 31 is among them. I am plucked to the very bone but I do not know how to refuse an application from you. So pray put me down Sovreign and dun me for it when we next meet.</p>
                        <p>I saw your son the other day &amp; was much interested by his account of a well sinking, on your coast, down into a slate rock. I had heard of it before but doubted of it. I hope you are all flourishing upon the glacial drift of Hitcham. My Lectures fatigue me - only 3 a week. - My 40th and <hi rend="underline">last</hi> course: &amp; the meetings in our <hi rend="underline">Combination room</hi>, about our new statutes, bother my senses. The reason of my frequent giddiness is that my brain is shrunk thro' age &amp; too big for its skull bone. Kind regards to your daughters.</p>
                        <p>I was not well during my Norwich residence in September. Frequent attacks of giddiness prevented me from preaching. Dick &amp; his wife, their four children &amp; two nurses, over and above my own household - so filled my residence that Fanny Hicks was obliged to sleep out at the Deanery. Isabella was detained at Dent by her father's horrible sickness.</p>
                        <p>I went to see him early in October &amp; remained as long as I could.</p>
                        <p>We had a very sorrowful parting for I did not think that I should ever see his living form again. I never [text illegible - page torn] of Mr Ralfs &amp; his work on the Desmidiaea, but wish you all success in your application.</p>
                        <p>Ever yours affectionately</p>

                        <p>P.S. I am writing as a sheep (as I have now discovered) [text illegible - page torn] which I had ten days since made a start &amp; come to a rather premature stop.</p>
