                  <p>Many thanks for your letter, but I am afraid we must conclude from it that we cannot <del>expect</del> hope for a lecture from you this winter, as I cannot undertake to deliver one at Ipswich. The truth is, lecturing is not at all my vocation, I find it a great exertion &amp; a great fatigue, &amp; I have therefore almost resolved not to attempt it except at Bury &amp; Mildenhall, where I am as it were at home. Moreover, of the 3 days you name, it so happens that February 10 is the very day fixed for my own lecture at Bury, &amp; on Jan 13 Mr Kingsley is engaged to deliver a lecture there, which I am particularly anxious to hear. But we should be extremely glad to see you here, lecture or no lecture, at any time this winter that you can come; &amp; I hope that you may yet be able to manage it, although you do seem to be formidably beset with engagements. As for lectures, having so many to deliver, I should think you must be tolerably sick of them. But you have never been here since our visit to Madeira &amp; Teneriffe, &amp; I have many things that I want to show you.</p>
                  <p>I was much interested by an account, which you may probably have seen, in the Literary Gazette, of Prof. Smyth’s astronomical &amp; philosophical operations on the Peak of Teneriffe. I know both the localities &amp; the persons mentioned, which made it the more interesting to me.</p>
                  <p>I do not know whether you may have heard of Lyell’s proceedings this autumn: he has been making a continental tour, visiting Berlin, Breslau, the Riesengebirge, Dresden, Prague, Vienna, the Austrian Alps, Salzburg, Munich, Strasbourg, &amp; Paris; seeing at each place the principal geologists, &amp; visiting under their guidance the chief geological localities;— a delightful tour! His letters have been full of most interesting &amp; important &amp; curious geological information, the pith of which will no doubt enrich the next editions of his Principles &amp; Manual.</p>
                  <p>Mrs Bunbury unites with me in kind remembrances to Miss Henslow as well as to yourself; &amp;, with some faint hope of seeing you here this winter, I remain</p>
                  <p>yours very sincerely, | C J F Bunbury</p>
