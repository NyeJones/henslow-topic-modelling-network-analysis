                  <p>Thanks for your letter. I this day have begun my residence: &amp; here D.G. I am to remain till the end of September.</p>
                  <p>Annie is I trust going on as well as possible &amp; the little one flourishing like a bay tree.—The judges did not hang me by the neck: but they gave me a dinner in our Lodge, &amp; I gave them one in Hall. After they went I had some hard work among my papers, &amp; I came hither on Monday Evening that I might be reader for a Chapter that was held yesterday; &amp; when it was done I made a start with my great pile of unanswered letters which by hard work I have considerably reduced in size. In about a fortnight I expect my Sister in Law &amp; my niece Isabella to come to me &amp; remain till the end of my residence.</p>
                  <p>My Sister in Law is so infirm of health that I fear I shall not be able to be so hospitable as I could wish &amp; as I used to be. But it so would delight me to see some of your family party in a quiet way</p>
                  <p>I mean to have the party of the minor Canons before <del>th</del> the ladies join me</p>
                  <p>At present I am in perfect solitude. Love to all your girls— especially dear Annie</p>
                  <p>Ever affectionately yours | A Sedgwick</p>
