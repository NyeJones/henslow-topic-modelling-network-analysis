                  <p>On my return home I found so much occupation &amp; then an unexpected summons back here, that I really have had no opportunity of fulfilling my promise to write before now– To answer your queres catagorically</p>
                  <p>1. The Celts occur in a brick earth pit at Honne &amp; tho' recent observations have not yet absolutely demonstrated the truth of M <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frere's original account in the Archiologia, I have now seen that account, &amp; am quite prepared to admit the extreme probability of its correctness, &amp; that the Celts really occur in <hi rend="underline">undisturbed </hi>Drift – of a <hi rend="underline">freshwater</hi> origin. The beds appear to cap the sides of a water course or valley of excavation, pretty much as described in regard to the Abbeville &amp; Amiens stations.</p>
                  <p>2. The Celts are unquestionably the work of man – very like those I have now seen from the French localities–</p>
                  <p>3. I suppose they were used as hatchets, mounted in horn or wood, after a fashion which has been found &amp; described in some (later) cases in Mons. Perthe's work &amp; others–</p>
                  <p>The age of this Drift I by no means consider to have been satisfactorily established but it must be very old– I have a fact to detail connecting Suffolk Drift which seems to show (in such cases as this) that it may &amp; <hi rend="underline">must</hi> be of rapid accumulation. Then comes the enquiry into the present conditions of the surface – &amp; I do not see why we may not suppose a considerable elevation throughout the N. of Europe to have taken place within a <hi rend="underline">moderate</hi> number of 1000's of years, sufficient to explain this– The facts related in the letter of the Danish Professor (whose name I forget) in the Athenæum, appear to prove that in some cases very little alteration indeed has taken place by the action of water upon the <hi rend="underline">mounds</hi> in which the savages who used these celts stored them, as it should seem (from Sir C. Lyell's account of a modern mound) as in an armoury– But I am not sufficiently up to the question to say much about it – I hope to visit the locality at Amiens, where I think it has been clearly demonstrated these weapons are found in undisturbed <hi rend="underline">Drift</hi>– I have now seen 2 photographs which are perfectly convincing– I have an examination to attend to tomorrow &amp; return home on Saturday – to find Louisa with 2 <hi rend="underline">sweet</hi> young ladies she is expecting, if we may judge by their name of Sugars.</p>
                  <p>Kind regards (to which Mrs Hooker bids me add hers) to Lady Afflick | Y <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> truly | J S Henslow</p>
