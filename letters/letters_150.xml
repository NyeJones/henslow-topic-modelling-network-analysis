                  <p>It is very difficult to form an idea of the value of one collection of plants without seeing them. I knew Sir Theo. Gage &amp; many of his plants; &amp; generally speaking what he collected himself were good &amp; beautifully preserved. He had some good Portuguese plants, a portion of which he gave to me: &amp; what Cryptogamia he collected in the South of Ireland &amp; those which he received from <del>the</del> Miss Hutchens are interesting. So that had you the offer of the whole of his collection I should say they are cheap at 25£. But as you <del>say</del> tell me part of them only is offered I hardly know what to say. The best part may &amp; probably is retained by his own family &amp; what they propose to dispose of may be duplicates only, &amp; they probably unnamed. The 200 Italian plants are good if named.– but Schleicher’s plants are trash. £25 will now a days buy 2,500 species if European plants well named, &amp; at the dearest rate. You know the Unio Itinerario offered their plants at about 30 <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> the 200. Reichenbach now offers (&amp; I have just sent Hunneman an order for a set of <del>of</del> German plants at 5 dollars the 100, beautifully dried &amp; carefully named. Still I am willing to allow that the circumstance of the collection you allude to, having been Sir Theo. Gage’s, increases their value:&amp; if there are a 1000 named species, Cryptogamia or otherwise, exclusion of Schleicher’s, I should say they are not dear. You should ask the family to give you in a collection of drawings of the Lichens of the Pleomyxa (?) family done by Sir Theo. <hi rend="superscript">s </hi> himself which were very beautiful.</p>
                  <p>I am truly glad to find you expressing a hope that you may visit Scotland this year. Can you not come before the end of June? I think at that time of going, not to Killin as usual, with my students, but to Inverary to explore 2 or 3 mountains in that neighbourhood. The Minister of Inverary, a fair Botanist &amp; a particular friend of mine has offered to be our guide; &amp; he is well acquainted with the whole country. I have just had a letter from Wilson who has returned to Warrington after an absence I think of more than a year. He has laid in a vast stock of specimens &amp; of knowledge too, &amp; I hope he will publish specimens of his Mosses. I have induced him to give some descriptions to Sowerby for his Supplement of Engl. Bot. <hi rend="superscript">y</hi> What he undertakes he will do well. He is really a very extraordinary man &amp; I scarcely know which to admire most his botanical acuteness or his private worth &amp; character.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hooker &amp; I both hope that when you travel in Scotland, M. <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Henslow will be with you. It will give us such pleasure to offer her every attention in our power <del>&amp;</del> &amp; if she has not yet visited the north she will see much to admire.</p>
                  <p>Ever most | truly &amp; faithfully yours |W. J. Hooker</p>
