                  <p>Audubon is still in America, &amp; I continue to receive money for Him on account of his work– I received a former payment from you through your Brother, of £6..1..0 (for 3 copies, minus the collection charge) which I have placed at my Bankers (Messr. <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> Wright, 5 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden) and where you may order what you have further to pay to be placed in <hi rend="underline">my name, Letter A</hi>. account– Audubon’s account having been so opened there, in order to enable me to draw upon any monies that I might have occasion to pay, for Him, from the funds lodged there– If you prefer it I will receive the money myself, and give you a receipt, but as I had, on the last occasion, to call &amp; send two or three times to your Brother’s Chambers, it will perhaps save all parties trouble if paid at once at Wrights, as above– Did I give you a receipt for the former payment? I fear not– If so, please do inform me when the second payment has been made &amp; I will send you immediately a proper receipt for the whole– I heard from Audubon a few weeks since – He was very well &amp; said nothing about his immediate return– I hope however that He will now hasten it</p>
                  <p>Ever my dear Sir | very truly yours| John Geo. Children</p>
