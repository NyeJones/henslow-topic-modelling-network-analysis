                        <p>For the last 3 or 4 years I have had a Curate, &amp; have not found it
                            necessary to return home for Sunday duty as I used to do when lecturing
                            here – Your letter has therefore been a little round &amp; I find it on
                            my return at 9.0. clk from a botanical excursion (rather a rainy one)
                            with 25 of my class who accompanied me to Gamlingay 15 miles from Camb.
                            We have had an agreeable day spite of the rain – Your Club are quite
                            mistaken in supposing the diagrams are intended exclusively for Lectures
                            – They are expressly adapted for Students– tho’ serviceable also in the
                            lecture room – I send you a notice I circulated in the Colleges, &amp; I
                            find they have been procured by some of them, expressly for the use of
                            the students – I know the Master of St Peters has procured one set to be
                            hung up for the students of that College, &amp; another set for his own
                            study, &amp; he assures me he finds them of great service – The Tutor of
                            Trinity (Mr Mathison) has done the same in procuring one set for access
                            by students &amp; another for his own use – &amp; I know other cases.
                            The matter printed on the sides of the diagrams would be of no use in a
                            Lecture room, but is intended for private inspection &amp; study.
                            Whoever will master this, will find himself in possession of the more
                            important terms &amp; their application, &amp; be able to proceed
                            merrily afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Believe me</p>
                        <p>very truly yours</p>
