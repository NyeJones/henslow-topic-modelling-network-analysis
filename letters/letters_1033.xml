                  <p>I returned the Galapagos Island plants on Saturday, having kept them as long as I could: they are carefully done whether well or no. Those of Macrae's I separated both the Maldive group &amp; Galapagos Isld ones, &amp; returned them today to the Hort. Soc. Museum.</p>
                  <p>I should have told you that I took the liberty of retaining those specimens that had <hi rend="underline">duplicate</hi> attached to them amounting I think to some 30 or 40 of the whole having thought that I had permission to do so there do not appear to be any specimens to spare amongst them &amp; pray do not break these upon any amount whatever as most of them are far too small as it is and I had to make some awful sacrifices in the examination, when the curious genera demanded it, though I was as saving as possible throughout, consistently with good determination.</p>
                  <p>I returned a bundle of Tropical ones at the same time, in general approximately named, there was nothing seen remarkable amongst them. The Fuegian Falkland Isld &amp; Patagonian plants I retain, they will be nearly all named very soon &amp; returned as soon as the Phanerogamic portion of my book is done, there are some excellent things amongst them: especially from S. Chile &amp; the Chonos Archipelago, Chiloe</p>
                  <p>The Niger flora is just begun &amp; I am including in it all the plants of tropical Africa, on the best count, from Cape Blanco to Great Fish River, I suppose you do not know where I can get such to my specimens from that shady world? The Niger Expedition plants form the foundation &amp; to them I add my own &amp; Darwin's Cape de Verd things. Don's W. African, Forbes' key ambigua (E. writes only in notes, &amp; a collection that E. Forbes had the goodness to offer me. In the Brit. Mus. I hope to have the use of C. Smith's Congo collections, Brass's Cape Coast ones &amp; some of Afzelius. From France we have some of Brunner's Senegambia &amp; Perrotets Senegal things &amp; I have written for a set of Hendelot's, then with other odds and ends will form a <hi rend="underline">Primitiva</hi> flora Af. occid. Trop.</p>
                  <p>Amongst Darwin's Galapagos things you will find nearly all Macrae's, from a fine set of my father's &amp; one or two I added from the Hort. Soc. sets, as I wished the Cantab. collection to be as complete as possible. My father desires his very kind regards in which we all join.</p>
                  <p>Ever with my great respect</p>
                  <p>Most truly Yours</p>
                  <p>Jos. D. Hooker</p>
