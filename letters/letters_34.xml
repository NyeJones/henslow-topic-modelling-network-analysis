                  <p>As I think it more than probable that Professor Sedgwick is at this time from Cambridge I take the liberty of making the enquiries of you that I had intended to have addressed to the Professor.</p>
                  <p>Walpole St And <hi rend="superscript">w’s </hi>where I am now residing, is to the west of Lynn near Long Sutton Wash. Situated in a large tract of flat land, called Marshland, which has been at different times embanked from the sea, which formerly overflowed it: Amongst the disadvantages that are attached to this country the greatest is the want of water: all the springs, which are found between 15 and 30 ft below the surface are salt water and these are in the alluvial deposit – our dependence therefore for water is upon the clouds: and in a season like the present you may suppose that our inconvenience is very great: perhaps you will have the kindness to inform me whether you think that there is any prospect of our obtaining water by shutting out these salt water land springs and by boring below them: if there be any fair probability of access it will be worth making the experiment: I have always been discouraged by the great extent of flat country that surrounds us on all sides: and by the circumstance that a gentleman of Lynn, which is 10 miles to our East: made a well upwards of 500 ft and obtained no water: But on looking at Conybeare &amp; Philip’s Geology of Eng &amp; W. a few days since I find that in page 57 he mentions that the experiment of boring had been successful in the Marshes about the Humber: which appears to be very similar to our Marshes here: this gives me a first gleam of hope: and I shall esteem it a great favor if you will give me your views of the case. Likewise if you can give me Professor Sedgwick and Mr Conybeare’s address–</p>
                  <p>Apologising for the liberty I have taken</p>
                  <p>I remain | Dear Sir | Yours faithfully | R.E. Hawkinson</p>
