                  <p>I am got so far on my way northwards, and in a letter which I got last night I have received intelligence about Ramsay which makes me write to beg you to tell me if you have heard anything more of him since I parted with you. I would willingly believe that my correspondent may be mistaken. Address me at the Post Office Manchester where I shall be in the beginning of next week.</p>
                  <p>I have been rambling about this country with great pleasure much delighted with the performances of the limestone and its rivers. On the whole I have had delightful weather, but my last expedition the day before yesterday was an exception. I went through Dovedale in a most persevering rain. In the middle of the glen and, of course, of the rain, I met Power, Thomas, and two other men I think both of Cambridge who were doing their duty <del>of</del> as seers of sights no less resolutely than Airy and myself. However Dovedale is worth a little inconvenience for I do not think anything can be more beautiful than the church part of the ravine with its spires of rock and robes of wood and mosses. Mrs Airy was <del>is a </del> one of our companions in the expedition of which this was a portion, but she fortunately avoided all the rainy part of our travels.</p>
                  <p>I suppose all in Cambridge is very quiet and solitary I expect to be there in about a month. Give my regards to Mrs Henslow and my love to Mesdemoiselles Fanny and Louisa. Mr Airy’s little creature is marvelously improved here, being shown incomparably more lively and intelligent than he was at Cambridge.</p>
                  <p>Dear Henslow | yours affectionately | W. Whewell</p>
