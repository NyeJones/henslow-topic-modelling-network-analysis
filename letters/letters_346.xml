                    <salute>Sir,</salute>

                  <p>By direction of Captain Alexander I have forwarded samples of the different products manufactured from the Schist or Shale, together with a piece of the raw material from which the products are obtained.</p>
                  <p>I enclose herewith a prospectus of the Company and also a Circular, with sundry bona fide Testimonials, of the Manure.</p>
                  <p>The Bituminous Schist or Shale is found on the Coast of Dorsetshire at Kimmeridge, the whole face of the Cliff is intersected with veins? [underlining and question mark: JSH] <del>being composed</del> of this substance – It is very easily dug up, and the supply is inexhaustible. It is a combination of animal and vegetable remains, intimately united by a Cement, having for its base Silicate of Alumina. The Shale is conveyed to the Company’s Works at Wareham, where it undergoes destructive distillation, which produces a thick black substance (liquid). The Asphalt (at least a greater part) is then precipitated by the aid of chemicals – and undergoes a process of washing of steam – The oil is then placed in a still and is rectified, and allowed to run over till the oil or spirit is not above a certain specific gravity – What remains is then placed in a Jar Still, and by being subjected to a greater heat than in the process of rectification a thick liquid grease is obtained; the remnant being allowed to run out at the bottom of the still in the shape of Asphalt.</p>
                  <p>The residuum remaining in the retorts is taken out immediately the Shale is carbonized and is placed into closed boxes to cool, so as not to allow the carbon to escape; and when cool, is mixed up with other compounds, &amp; makes the Manure.</p>
                  <p>The Company have been proceeding for some time past on a very small scale, but now having proved the marketability of their products, they have been lately making very extensive additions to their Works, which are in a forward state of completion – the number of retorts erecting are 120 which, it is expected, will carbonize 150 Tons of Shale per week: which will allow of their sending about 1000 gallons of oil or spirit, 4 Tons of Asphalt, a considerable quantity of Grease, and upwards of 100 Tons of Manure into the market per week.</p>
                  <p>The Manure has been tried by various parties with most beneficial results – and is recommended for all root crops – and for corn– One gentleman who tried some informed us that it quite destroyed the wire worm.</p>
                  <p>The Grease sent you will find has a most offensive smell but we expect that this will be nearly if not quite removed when we begin to manufacture on a large scale</p>
                  <p>The Jet Varnish Paint is made from the Asphaltum– it has been tested by the Ordnance at Woolwich and has been approved also by the Eastern Counties R <hi rend="superscript">y </hi>C <hi rend="superscript">o</hi> who also speak highly of it– Its properties are drying very quickly– requiring no priming; and going much further than Paint – when dry it leaves a beautiful polish on the article painted.</p>
                  <p>The Volatile Oil or spirit is a white clear liquid; is a solvent of India rubber &amp; Gutta Percha – and is adapted for many purposes in the Arts &amp; Manufactures to which Naptha &amp; Camphire are applicable–</p>
                  <p>The samples I have forwarded are</p>

                  <p>Any further information I shall be happy to afford on hearing from you. You will find the properties of the different products set forth in the Prospectus &amp; Circular enclosed.</p>
