                  <p>I have given a copy of your list of desiderata to my father, who can answer better than I can the question whether there are any duplicates of Conifers here.— I am sorry to hear that you have had such a sick house, but we can well match you in that respect. At the time I received your letter, I was first recovering from a very troublesome &amp; disagreeable malady, rather an odd one too for my time of life, —the measles,— which <del>attacked</del> had kept me a close prisoner several weeks, &amp; left me very weak; indeed I did not really recover till we came hither for change of air. And in this house, Lady Bunbury, Miss Napier &amp; my father, have all been invalids, but I am happy to say that they are all doing well. I trust that Mrs Henslow &amp; your other invalids are all completely recovered. I understand that the season has been a very sickly one, &amp; certainly the weather at present is any thing but genial or promising. As soon as it shall become suitable for travelling, Mrs Bunbury &amp; I meditate a journey to Torquay to spend there the season of the March winds.</p>
                  <p>Pray remember me to Mrs Henslow &amp; the rest of your family. Mrs Bunbury unites with me in kind regards.</p>
                  <p>Believe me | yours very truly | C.J.F Bunbury</p>
