            <p>Approves of the idea of a system of allotments for the agricultural population if they are near to their cottages. Reluctant to attend a meeting of Suffolk proprietors as his views differ greatly from most of them, particularly in relation to the Corn Laws.</p>

                  <p>I thank you for your letter &amp; its enclosure which I read with much interest. I have no doubt that if the system of allotment adjacent the cottages were generally adopted, it would make a great change for the latter in the condition &amp; habits of the <del>laboring class</del> married portion of the agricultural population, But the allotments should be near the cottages, otherwise they will not assume the intended purpose.</p>
                    <p>As my vacation is approaching I should be <del>about</del> probably tempted to attend the proposed meeting of Suffolk proprietors if it were not that my opinions on some essential points differ so much from those of the great majority of them, that they would be very unacceptable to such one assembly. I cannot but consider the existing corn laws are a very great mistake, as being equally inpolitic and unjust. I believe that while they remain as they are there will be <hi rend="underline">no peace in Israel</hi>; and that if they were placed on another footing the agriculturalists would be surprized to find in the first instance that the change was productive of no harm to themselves &amp; that ultimately it would improve instead of deteriorating <del>their</del> the conditions of <del>ar</del> all parties, landlords, farmers &amp; labourers</p>
                  <p>Always Dear Sir | yours faithfully | B C Brodie</p>
