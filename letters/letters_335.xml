                  <p>I am very much out of spirits in consequence of a broken shin which deprives me of carriage so necessary to my health – I had a fall last Monday, &amp; inflicted several furrows on my face that made it anything but beautiful. It is now however in all its pristine beauty; but my leg bothers me, &amp; will not get well, &amp; I am not permitted across my house. Had M. <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Henslow been able to come she would have made me well in a moment. I do not think your section right. There is no fault like you have drawn to the south of the chalk ridge in the I. of Wight– none, at least, that I could ever discover– your section at any rate is quite wrong – for the upper greensand is packed regularly under the highly inclined chalk – then comes the gault – &amp; then the Shanklin series underlaid by the Weald clay without any fault. These become gradually horizontal in the ridge of S <hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Catherine on the south coast. What an active fellow Sidney is – and without being profound he is a good bellows blower &amp; keeps the ball going- What an incredible service Brown w <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have done, if to his gigantic knowledge he had added Sidney’s physical energy &amp; love of public display. My love to all your womankind</p>
                  <p>Ever yours | A Sedgwick</p>
