                  <p>My dear Sir</p>
                  <p>Very many thanks for the report &amp; Programme which I received at Sidmouth on my return leisurely homewards from a five months exploration en patrimonade with my son and grandson - the William Spences - of Cornwall &amp; Devonshire, the Lands End, Dartmoor, the valley of the Tamar &amp; Tavy etc. etc.</p>
                    <p>I read the Report &amp; Programme with great interest &amp; heartily congratulate you on the gratifying success of your labours - for the slight [illeg] from every conceit &amp; ingnorance you must have had all along &amp; your going on year after year in spite of them when so many would have thrown up the whole thing in disgust, shows how truly you are <hi rend="underline">the Man </hi> to have devised &amp; carried out such admirable plans of teaching science &amp; rural economy to the working classes. Your excellent idea of lecturettes instead of lectures I applied after my son left for the Br. Assoc <hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; to visit Sir W. Stewart (?), in giving my grandson some notions of geology from the Red Sandstone beds of Sidmouth &amp; the flints without end - the remains of the chalk foundation strewing their surface all the way to Lyme Regis </p>
                    <p>An American Aloe at Penzance in the open ground of a cottage garden with a noble candelabrum - like a flowering stem 15 ft high &amp; 4 to 5 inches diameter at the base, amply confirmed the mild character of the climate, but the winds are too violent to allow the trees &amp; shrubs showing the same luxuriance of growth as at Torquay - truly the Italy of England - with villas 200 feet above sea level backed by full - grown Elms (not stunted &amp; shorn as on our East Coast) &amp; the houses as on the terraces have forground of Sweet Bay Arbutus etc. through which they see the sea, just as if used I used to admire so much in views of the Medditerranean (sic) in going from Nice to Genoa.</p>

                  <p>Yours</p>
                  <p>My dear Sir</p>                   
                  <p>Yours very truly</p>
                  <p>W. Spence</p>
