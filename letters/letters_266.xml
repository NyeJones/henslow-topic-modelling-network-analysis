                  <p>When you were here you said you would see whether you had not a specimen or so of the edible swallow's nest for me, and I quite intended to jog your memory before you took leave of Swaffham.</p>
                  <p>My plan of exhibiting objects of Nature and Art under a Marquee and giving explanatory lectures upon them seems to give so much pleasure and satisfaction that I am very desirous of scraping all together into my now very tidy attic of whatever I can lay hands on. If you therefore stumble on anything, from a stray planet down to one of the fleas of Eton memory, pray put it up for me. When you go again to Tenby you should call on C. Parker (whom you may remember to have seen here) and he can show you the objects worth seeing, and introduce you to Mr. Griffith and daughters (also acquaintances of mine), who are Algologists and would show you the best of British specimens of Algae. The Georges are at present with us as you know.</p>
                  <p>Our kind regards to your wife and believe me | Ever affey. yrs. | J S Henslow</p>
                  <p>PS. I send a programme of my last exhibition that you may see the sort of things I am glad of – I don't know whether Harriet has before sent it or not.</p>
