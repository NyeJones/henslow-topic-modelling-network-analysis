                  <p>I have not forgotten your request respecting the waste Examination papers. The practice of the University is to keep them for two years, and then to dispose of them to a Paper-Manufacturer, who gives an undertaking that they shall be sent direct to the Paper mill, without finding their way into other hands. As I presume that this was originally arranged by the Senate, I should not like, without their concurrence, to make any other use of the old papers; but I can apply to them in your behalf if you would like me to do so.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, I have had the blank leaves taken from such of the books as had not been stripped by the Examiners; and they are ready to forward to you in any way you may direct.</p>
                  <p>I presume it to have been from my brother that you have received the Monograph on Cracidae, as it was not sent by me. He is off to America for a 6 month’s run, of which he hopes to pay the expenses by lecturing.</p>
                  <p>With the best wishes of the season, believe me</p>
                  <p>yours most truly |William B. Carpenter</p>
