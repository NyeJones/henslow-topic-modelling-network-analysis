                  <p>I was most happy in adding your name to the list of those who have wished to do honour to the Memory of our lamented Friend. No one I am sure ever thinks that the respect of the donor for the deceased is to be measured by the amount of the sum it may be convenient to him to give. I find with you that it is very necessary to set bounds to my wishes on such occasions, so many are the holes now bored all round the cistern. The sums subscribed already amount to £286, so that we shall have enough to do all we contemplate.</p>
                  <p>You again send me a letter without saying when we are to have you here. I expect our spare room to be occupied from the 25 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to the 29th by a friend, a lady from Berlin and about the 9 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of next month we shall be going from home for a week, and at the end of it my official circuit will begin, &amp; will last two months. Thus you see how we are situated, &amp; I hope that we shall certainly see you before long.</p>
                  <p>I have a cask &amp; a hamper packed with specimens for the Ipswich Museum if you wish to have them, &amp; a third package is in progress. They are not valuable, but I think they are worth the carriage upon the whole. What do you say? You will not in the least offend me by saying, “I would rather not have them”</p>
                  <p>Yours faithfully | Leonard Horner [JSH writes: ‘Factory Schools Inspector’]</p>
                  <p>We had a most satisfactory examination of our Highgate British School yesterday evening. We have been most fortunate in our Master. I hope you will be no less so in the new Mistress about to come to you.</p>
