                        <p>You were so obliging last year to assist me in procuring 2 birds I wanted, &amp; to say you would not be indisposed to attend to any little request of this sort, as I cannot readily here procure assistance. My son in Law, Dr Hooker, is here &amp; goes tomorrow to the Royal Society, &amp; will take up a little box containing 11 badly stuffed birds, which I shall be glad to submit to your inspection, that I may be quite sure of each individual; &amp; then, if you would be so good as to send someone for them, who can mount them properly under a glass frame, I shall be much obliged.</p>
                        <p>[Diagram of glass box]</p>
                        <p>They belonged to my late Father, who was very proud of breeding birds &amp; some of them are mules of his own breed, between Canaries, Goldfinches, Greenfinches, &amp; Linnets. I dare say you can tell me <hi rend="underline">which</hi> is <hi rend="underline">which</hi>. These I should like disposed towards <hi rend="underline">one side</hi> of the case (<hi rend="underline">Hybrids</hi>). The rest consist of a few white &amp; mottled vars. of Sparrow, Bulfinch, Chaffinch, &amp;c &amp; these I should like disposed towards the other side of the case. A branch forking off in opposite directions near the bottom would be a good starting point for such grouping. I should wish to have the power of lifting up the glass from its stand in case I should desire to add a stray specimen or so of the like description and to add their names to them. I have materials enough for my <hi rend="underline">Marquee Museum</hi> on July 12th this year - but I should like to have this case quite ready by August, when I shall be in town &amp; could bring it back safely myself, in time for my second Show. If you will be so good as to let me know to whose care you entrust the adjusting of these birds, I can call or send for them when ready.</p>
                        <p>Yrs very truly</p>
