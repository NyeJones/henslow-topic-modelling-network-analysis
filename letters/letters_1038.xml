                  <p>Sir W. Hooker remarks that he should like to see the model before deciding to purchase for his mus. but does not seem to like the idea of its not being of the full size, &amp; only in the young state, &amp; not a <hi rend="underline">cast</hi>. All points which occurred to me also. That he mentions a fact which I think ought to be made known to you, &amp; I cannot consider it a breach of confidence in giving you his own words - "I am sorry to see Baron Ludwig spoken of there, as having been employed by the Duke of Devonshire to collect for him in S. Africa. Baron L., whose portrait you may have seen in my study, is the Sir Joseph Banks of that region, though of humble origin. His fine garden he throws open to visitors as Kew is open: &amp; those magnificent Cycadeae were sent unasked as a present to the Duke, doubtless hoping for a few plants in return for his own collection:- but the good Baron never received a Plant nor a thank! - &amp; probably no fault of the Duke"</p>
                  <p>Excuse me, if I have taken too great a liberty in extracting this sentence - but it would be a pity if a copy of your programme should reach the Baron under the circumstances of the case, &amp; I think you might feel annoyed if he were to reply to it.</p>
