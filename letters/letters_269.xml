                  <p>Sir Wm. H. writes me word that he has written to you touching the houses for the Bot-Gard. He seems to be very anxious we should not go wrong, &amp; he calls Stratton "an excellent fellow"– I have no doubt he will assist in any way as the scheme advances, in suggesting improvements– The Curator Smith, at Kew, is a very experienced man, &amp; he quite agrees with Sir W <hi rend="superscript">m</hi> in his strictures on the plan suggested, but I presume he has written to you in detail &amp; I need not repeat what they think– I am (I believe) all but well again, but am desired to be prudent for the future – &amp; not to sit up so late at night, or over-pay myself – with multiplicity of work– Ch! Jenyns &amp; his wife are here – the former busy in drawing me a series of types of the Animal Kingdom for our Ipswich Museum. He has just knocked off the Great Kangaroo, &amp; is now fingering one of the humps of a Camel– I am glad to find L. R. H. has lost none of his feathers, though he was unable to swan above the poll–</p>

                  <p>Poor Shelford has left a widow &amp; 12 children wholly unprovided for, &amp; we are about to have a meeting among the clergy to devise something to be done for them–</p>
