                        <p>The whole affair about the Books is a blunder of mine as second hand you should have an advantage in the price &amp; I have much pleasant recollections of the Ipswich Museum that I am determined they shall have the advantage I purposed for them. Now for the Widow, she has received from me a Guinea more than she was entitled to by right but there again I could not recall the Guinea for [text illegible] the demand because I know it is of service to her &amp; would vex her not to have it after having calculated upon it &amp; so you will that there is no other comfortable solution of the affair than that the faulty party should bear the loss which he can very well afford &amp; does not care a farthing about. And now there is an end of the matter &amp; let me hope that you have recd the glosses &amp; find them to your liking &amp; let me add that if they are <hi rend="underline">not</hi> I have a customer for them who saw them in my possession &amp; who will relieve you of them with pleasure, but my idea is that you will find them just the lot that you required.</p>
                        <p>I heard from Mr J. Hooker that you were well about a week since &amp; hope you and yours continue so. I regret to say Mrs B has kept her bed for the last fortnight with another attack of Bronchitis</p>
