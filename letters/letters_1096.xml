                        <p>I most cordially agree in the sentiments expressed in the account you
                            have just forwarded – &amp; for which I beg to thank you. The statement
                            you noticed in the G. Chronicle is not overaccurate (as you may have
                            observed) – My little girls don’t pretend to describe minutely – but
                            some of them are well acquainted with very nearly all the Hitcham wild
                            flowers – &amp; can pretty readily refer garden plants to
                            such Natural orders as they have learnt &amp; recognize among the wild
                            plants – You would have enjoyed seeing them on Friday exploring the
                            margins of a large field in Brettenham Park where we spent the afternoon
                            &amp; added 2 species to our Flora – winding up the day with a
                            Bread &amp; Cheese Jam &amp; Cake, Lemonade &amp; Raspberry Vinegar
                            &amp; bidding good bye to the solitary woods &amp; glen with a few songs
                            &amp; hymns–</p>
                        <p>I am truly sorry I had no opportunity for calling in my short visit to
                            Sir B. Brodie – I did not know till just as I left London that I was to
                            pass near Reigate, &amp; on conferring with Sir B. I found I could not
                            continue to call– I was pressed for time &amp; had to get home next day
                            – If ever I revisit him, I shall hope to arrange better</p>
                        <p>Believe me</p>
                        <p>very truly yours</p>
