                  <p>If I bore you say so - but you have rather encouraged me to talk of Post Office arrangements in connection with Sunday - &amp; I send you the enclosed rough sketch of an answer I am sending to my friend &amp; neighbour who has just got up a petitition against you - &amp; is very actively engaged in support of some of our religious societies - We entirely disagree on some questions, though (I trust) we are equally convinced in our own minds. Now it seems to me that all who are taking the same view of Christian's calling with myself are as much entitled to freedom of opinion as those who are taking a different view. These questions (as matters of conscience) should be left open - &amp; the truth is more likely to prevail, than we if we are all to square our consciences by other men's measures. If I am wrong, I have no doubt I shall be brought to see the truth. But whilst I cannot perceive my error I shall take the liberty, (I could not refuse to others), of standing or falling to my own muster. Whatever the Legislature may determine upon respecting the observations of the Lords Day, I shall cheerfully submit to - however I may esteem it an infringement on our Christian privileges to have such straightness imposed upon us as may be satisfactory to the most Puritanical</p>
