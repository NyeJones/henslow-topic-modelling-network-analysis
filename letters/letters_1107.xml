                        <p>I have only just returned from fetching Mrs H. from London. I had not time
                            before leaving home to write – I see that J. H. Brewer’s work is out – I
                            mentioned my wish to subscribe to it. If he will be so good to forward
                            my copy by post &amp; let me know the expence of work &amp; postage I
                            will send him a P. O. order.</p>
                        <p>Many thanks for your good address to the Members of the Reigate Mec.
                            Inst– I am glad to see how much we agree, of on the advantages that are
                            likely to accrue from the study of Nat. history – I carried over to
                            Ipswich last Tuesday my head botanist (just 14 yr old) to be examined
                            for a pupil teachership – &amp; when we got there she said she had seen
                            (by the roadside 3 plants she had never found in Hitcham – I told her to
                            stop me as we returned &amp; point them out – which true enough she did,
                            &amp; got out of the chaise &amp; gathered them – &amp; told me their
                            Orders tho’ she was of course ignorant of their names – you have
                            probably seen that I am sending a series of articles to the G.C. on the
                            plan I have pursued in giving our Village Children a little insight into
                            Botany. A friend 8 miles off [had/has?] taken it up also – &amp; I have
                            proposed that we bring our respective botanists acquainted by an
                            interchange of visits &amp; so have a Village botanical match at each
                            others habitats</p>
                        <p>Yrs very truly</p>
