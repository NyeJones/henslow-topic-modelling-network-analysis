                        <p>I thought I had sent you my last letter (the enclosed) with the others –
                            you may perhaps have seen the kind of ridicule which the Reporter of the
                            Times has cast upon it – I shall in very few words allude to it in the
                            Gardeners Chronicle – Thanks for the Book, which I will look at with
                            attention – I am quite sensible of the imputations to which I lay myself
                            open in so often alluding to those principles by which we are desired to
                            guide ourselves in every thing we do. But you will understand me when I
                            say that I have had far more the conditions of the Gentry than the
                            conditions of the poor in my eye in the communications I have made – If
                            some of these principles were a little more wrought into their hearts I
                            should have no fear about the conditions of the Poor. If the Gentry
                            would interfere, the Farmer must follow, &amp; thus all would be well.
                            To say this directly would be as unpalatable as the Income Tax – But if
                            something can be done indirectly in this way for the present, we may
                            hope to see the time arise when more direct appeal will not be scoffed
                            at – Thanks for your card of sympathy &amp;</p>
                        <p>Believe me</p>
                        <p>very truly yours</p>
