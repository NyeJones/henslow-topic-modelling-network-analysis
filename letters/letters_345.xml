                  <p>[In JSH’s handwriting: ‘Sedgwick with left hand!’]</p>
                  <p>Romilly wrote a letter for me yesterday addressed to M. <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Henslow: but I cannot be content without telling you that I did not misinterpret your former letters. I thought them most kind &amp; good &amp; was truly thankful for them. But I did not write again because I have literally been pulled down to the earth by my correspondents, &amp; have had no time for writing to you as I would have wished. Several times I have been thrown back, &amp; put into a [a] state of fever &amp; I deprived of an entire night’s rest by fatiguing myself with writing; &amp; over &amp; over again my Surgeon has ordered me not to write on any account whatsoever. About the end of the last week I almost recovered my power of sleeping; &amp; I felt quite joyous &amp; happy. On Monday I over-exerted myself and wrote more than I ought to have done. On Monday night I was in perfect wretchedness from irritation &amp; felt as if someone was playing St Vitus’ jig all night behind my pillow. I never closed my eyes in slumber. Saturday night I was not much better for I only slept thro’ powerful opiates &amp; had a succession of disgusting &amp; frightful dreams. On Wednesday I came round again &amp; thank God I am now very well again. This will explain why I have not written to you. I am still involved in complicated bandages which cannot be removed for ten days or a fortnight more But my fractured arm &amp; bruises are going on very well. I wish with all my heart I could come to you but it is quite impossible My left arm does good service but in dressing &amp; undressing I am as helpless as an infant. I was truly sorry to hear the Julian news: but I trust all will end well &amp; that Hooker has long since had his liberty &amp; is now remembering his confinement as an agreeable episode in his Oriental history. I must not write anymore. My best love to all your family party</p>
                  <p>Ever affectionately yours |A Sedgwick</p>
                  <p>P.S. I will direct this to M. <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Henslow as you may be away –</p>
