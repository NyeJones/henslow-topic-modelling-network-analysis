                  <p>You may set down Watson for a promise, and Trail of Trin. as favourable. I have had a very agreeable answer to my letter from Lane, who, as no doubt you are by this time aware, giving us a vote.</p>
                  <p>We have no committee room still, but I have recommended one which will suit us - the only one it is to be had in this neighbourhood. I have not yet seen our noble Lord, but hope to do so today. If he fixes an early day for assembling his London Friends I shall make a point of attending - if he does not, I shall probably be gone to Brighton,</p>
                  <p>Mrs Watson is all but well again. I take part of their family dinner tomorrow and they send their regards to the Gothic Cottage.</p>
                  <p>May one ask the Chairman to send the enclosed letter to St Johns College? My nephew lives in the third court in illeg the fellow commoners room. I wish you would send me up a list of what you have picked up since Sunday, as, not having seen Palmerston I am quite in the dark - and am growing fidgetty. Now however there is no cause for dispondency - every person, almost without exception, says Palmerston ought to be re-elected.</p>
                  <p>Watkinson of Illeg adverses(?) as I am sorry to say. Ever since -- and yrs faithfully</p>
                  <p>Carrighan, A.</p>
                  <p>Tell Haverland I have seen nothing of Wilkinson, but have left the letter on the shelf of the Club.</p>
                  <p>Cook of Clare-Hall who is cordially with us, gives his 2nd to Bankes.</p>
