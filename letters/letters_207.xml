                  <p>– A periodical work of a very general character designed for popular instruction is about to be established here in which several persons holding a conspicuous position in the ranks of politics and literature take a deep interest. It will be a great organ of the more enlightened and respectable section of the liberal party which looks forward to the instruction of the middle classes and the better part of the operatives as the best security for social order &amp; national prosperity. The political part of the work will receive the support of the bulk of the liberal party and the prised contributors of several of its distinguished leaders. In the Literary department Mr.E. Lytton Bulmer will be a chief contributor and will enrich the work by a series of popular literary essays. Those who interest themselves in this measure turn with some anxiety to the lights of science and supplicate their co-operation and from now are the more solicitous for [comiten] assistance than from yourself. Tho the aid you can give will be great, the contribution expected from you would be small.</p>
                  <p>The will be published in monthly numbers of 64pp about half of which will be devoted to short popular sketches or questions of passing interest in the sciences arts and manufacturers – In botany there is no one to whom we can more naturally look for assistence than youself. may we then expect to have from time to time as subjects may offer themselves notices of points in your sciences? I have written to Herschell Brester &amp; others and have no doubt that we shall have their aid in this good work–</p>
                  <p>Pray favor me with an answer addressed to me at Liverpool whether I am going to execute one of the commissions of the British association – I leave tomorrow &amp; shall remain about three weeks – As we wish to ascertain our forces as soon as possible pray favor me with a line by an early post.</p>
                  <p>It is hoped that the work will afford as handsome an honorarium for its contributors as any other journal.</p>
                  <p>Believe me Dear Sir | Yours very sincerely | Dion. Lardner</p>
