                  <p>I send you some further mema.</p>
                  <p>I make out 694 votes of which 18 are conditional but we may reckon upon having 700 promises of one sort or other by Tuesday; of these I fear we shall not have not less that 100 absentees, which would reduce our numbers to 600 present but as I count 160 plumpers Supposing 100 of then come we may surely get 50 second votes by exchanges so as to make 650, and if we poll that number I think we shall succeed.</p>
                  <p>I should add that Richd. Parry gives us his second vote in exchange for one of our plumpers who wanted to vote for Copley. Sir Watkin will not come so you may as well counter order his horses. I found that it was almost certain that the Vice Chancellor would reject his vote, and as he would have had to run across the country &amp; back again between two elections to his great inconvenience I though it best to release him at once; I shall not start till tomorrow night and it is just possible I may not be off till Sunday evng. if I find which is not unlikely that I can be more usefully employed here than in Cambridge till then</p>
                  <p>Yrs sincerely</p>
