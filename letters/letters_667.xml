                  <p>Your kind note reached me safely and I write to thank you for the invitation it contained and to say that I should have much pleasure in searching out the natural treasures of your neighbourhood but cannot say when I may be able to do so, meantime many things of interest no doubt occur to you in the Fungus line, which I should like much to see and the postman would be very willing to deliver here at no great charge.</p>
                  <p>Do you ever come this way? If so it would [sic] Mrs Broome &amp; myself much pleasure to see you here and should Mrs Henslow accompany you I should be very happy to introduce her to Mrs Broome; you have also an inducement in Leonard Jenyns living in the neighbourhood.</p>
                  <p>Hoping to see something of your mycology one way or another</p>
                  <p>believe me | yours very truly | C E Broome</p>
                    <p>I most distinctly told W.J. that I am not authorized to pay him any money from the Club without receiving a Medical Certificate, backed by your own — but that I would pay whatever was thus certified to be his due — Dr G (the son of our Medical Advisor)</p>
                    <p>(In JSH’s hand a rough draft scribbled out not relevant to this letter to C.E.Broome)</p>
