                  <p>Sir,</p>
                  <p>I hope you will excuse me if I beg your particular attention to the following printed page respecting a publication of mine, relating to trees and shrubs, entitled the “Arboretum Britannicum”. You will observe that it is a book calculated to be of great use to landed proprietors, as well as to all who take an interest in the subject on which it treats; and hence, if you do not already possess it, I earnestly hope that the utility of the book, and the circumstances detailed in the printed page referred to, may induce you to order a copy.</p>
                  <p>But should you either already possess the “Arboretum Britannicum”, or not desire to possess it, then I respectfully beg leave to direct you attention to the Abridgement of that work, entitled “An Encyclopaedia of Trees and Shrubs”, and to the other publications ennumerated in the last page of this sheet; hoping that you may think it worth while to order one or more of them, which in my particular case, I shall consider an act of very great kindness and liberality.</p>
                  <p>In order to save you trouble, I enclose a form to be filled up and returned by post; or I shall be greatly obliged by an answer to this application in any other way that you may think fit.</p>
                  <p>Trusting that you will excuse me for the liberty I have taken in thus addressing you.</p>
                  <p>I remain | Sir | Your obedient Servant | J. C. Loudon</p>
                  <p>P. S. The names of those who subscribe to the Arboretum in consequence of this address, will be published from time to time in the “Gardener’s Magazine”, and in the "Gardener’s Chronicle”.</p>
                  <p>Mr Loudon takes the liberty of sending this letter and its enclosure to Professor Henslow in order to show him the use which Mr Loudon is making of the permission which Professor Henslow so kindly granted.</p>
