                  <p>Delayed by accident</p>
                  <p>Your kind letter just received and the highly gratifying intelligence which it contains oblige me to inflict on your patience the penalty of perusing another dolorous danish letter from me. But you will understand my feelings and you will pardon the intrusion. My sole object is to thank you cordially for all your polite attention, and to assure you, that I will do my best to supply you, in future, with far more acceptable selections of specimens, than that was, which you have so generously and in so gratifying a manner accepted of.</p>
                  <p>A laudato lacedari is a subject of honest pride; and I will endeavour to deserve a portion of the good you are pleased to say of my feeble efforts in the cause of Botany. I have not the slightest doubt but the highly respectable missive from your University and the Vice Chancellors letter will be received with the <del>ill.</del> greatest satisfaction by the authorities at the India House.</p>
                  <p>The idea of printing labels for the Company’s contributions appears to me extremely suitable, and the specimen you have favoured me with in your letter is entirely what I think it ought to be. The Nepenthes’s have not yet been printed, that is to say the sheet (67- <hi rend="superscript">th</hi>) on which the species will appear. I will however [illeg] a mem <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of the precise manner in which they will be recorded on that sheet.</p>
                  <p>Once more accept of my very best thanks for your polite attention &amp; believe me with the greatest regard</p>
                  <p>Dear Sir | Yours very truly | N. Wallich</p>
                  <p>[P.S.] Most happy should I have been to supply you with a double set of the lithographized list, as I have done in three other instances. But unfortunately my copy is so reduced in number [torn ill.] not do it.</p>
