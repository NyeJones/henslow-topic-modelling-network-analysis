                  <p>I merely wish to place before you facts which evidently you have never known; – not to bias your judgment, or attempt to influence it. The £3,000 was named by me as the cost price. I did not set the value of 3,000 on it. One of the valuations that I made was as high as £6000! – I was offered &amp; am still £3000–; but the dispersion would result. People must draw their own conclusions; – but the public (of respectability &amp; antiquarians) has never more boldly spoken against cliquism &amp; Flunkeyism than in this case: – These are 300 to 1! The dreary Trustees were in no way driven by the newspapers! Whoever has suggested this absurd notion has been misled.</p>
                  <p>But within 10 days after I made the offer, ere these Trustees (see their names!) pronounced articles were written &amp; published depreciating the Collection!! Of course we know (I do certainly), whence came these feelers &amp; probers of the public pulse. The late valuation does not settle the matter by any means! It would have done so had it gone against me!</p>
                  <p>The coin you allude to was exhibited (in a cast) at the last Numismatic Society’s meeting.</p>
                  <p>There is ‘a job’ I see going on in the Isle of Wight in which Sir R. Murchison (one of the Faussett Saxon antiquities’ judges!!) is to play a part! Our country is the hot-bed of all sorts of inconsistencies.</p>
                  <p>Your’s very truly | C Roach Smith</p>
