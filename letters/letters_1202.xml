                        <p>If my opportunities for entomological pursuits have been curtailed, I can assure you that my favour towards the science is in no way abated. It therefore gives me great pleasure to find that you intend adding to our Cambridge collection &amp; I can assure you, your present will be duly estimated whenever it arrives. My time is certainly pretty well occupied at present &amp; I can only hope for leisure to attend to the arrangement of the Socy's collection during the long vacation. Pupils, sermons, stones, <hi rend="doubleUnderline">wife</hi> are all added to my lot since we used to talk about Papilis, Sphinx, Carabus &amp;c. My brother in law L. Jenyns is still working hard &amp; we hope in a few years to have ascertained a sufficient no. of Cambridge animals &amp; vegetables to publish a natural history of the county. You are indeed a most indefatigable man &amp; the long list of names with whom you correspond &amp; to whom you send specimens is <hi rend="doubleUnderline">truly awful</hi>(!!!). Bulwer I believe to be in Ireland. He promised to send me a large box of shells about a year &amp; a half ago but has not. I hope your report of Leach is correct &amp; that he may again be restored to his friends and the world, but I sadly fear he will never recover sufficiently to enable him to pursue his old employment with any degree of labor. L. Jenyns &amp; I went to to Gamlingay in August to look for Daplidia &amp; Lithonia in hopes of a 2d brood - but alas we returned empty hand - but have vowed to return again next season. We have have got a Stylops</p>
