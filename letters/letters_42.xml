                  <p>I had the pleasure of receiving your obliging letter yesterday, and hasten to assure you that I promise myself much gratification in the correspondence about to be established between us; and that you may rely upon my doing every thing in my power to assist your views. Most heartily glad I am that you are going to raise the standard of Botanical Science in a place where it has slept so long—</p>
                  <p>I am not sure that I can give you any hints upon the subject of lectures that you will not have already attained. Like yourself I never attended a course of lectures on botany, and have only delivered a single popular course of 19 lectures. At the present moment however I am busied in composing a full course of 55 lectures, for next summer, which I mean to give independently of my popular one. The one chiefly for medical students, the other for “Ladies &amp; Gentlemen”.</p>
                  <p>The plan I have adopted is simply as follows.</p>
                  <p>1. The nature of the subject– distinctions between plants &amp; animals ?– for which the best work to consult is Lamarck’s Animaux sano…? (the introductory discourse).</p>
                  <p>2. The utility of Botany and also of plants to mankind.</p>
                  <p>3. History of Botany.</p>
                  <p>4. Geography of Plants.</p>
                  <p>5. Anatomy &amp; Physiology of D <hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. Very useful articles are Anatomy Vegetable and Vegetable Physiology in Suppl. to Enc. Britannica by Dan. <hi rend="superscript">l</hi> Ellis. Consult also Dr A. Todd Thompson’s lect. On Bot. <hi rend="superscript">y</hi> (no.1. only published)</p>
                  <p>6. Terminology and internal characters.</p>
                  <p>7. Classification.</p>
                  <p>8. Cryptogamia – which I treat as a distinct subject.</p>
                  <p>I believe I differ from much lecturers in treating of classification last, but it seems to me absurd to talk of classifying bodies whose characters we are not acquainted with. Those who are impatient I refer to my elementary work.</p>
                  <p>After I commence with my desdecriptions of the external characters – of Roots Stems &amp;c &amp;c– I begin to demonstrate in the Classroom – even though <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the terms should not be understood – a quarter of an hour at first, &amp; afterwards half an hour of the lecture is thus occupied– 2–5 specimens are sufficient, but they should be as perfect as possible – even with roots if they can be had – and the demonstrations should be full regular descriptions – such as are in the <hi rend="underline">Flora Londinensis</hi> which I have often copied for the purpose. For particular <del>parts</del>points, as the corolla alone on the Calyx – of course I never gave more than that part. Allow me to suggest that the greatest possible assistance to a lecturer is derived from magnified colored drawings – I prepared 100 Elephant folio ones for my first course &amp; shall have as many more. I had Sap vessels as thick as my arm– the Red Snow as large as Common Balls– the flower of Campanula rotundifolia 16 inches long and the rest in the same proportions. The principal forms of leaves I also delineated, &amp; thus illustrated in the Classroom, subjects which are usually studied by means of books &amp; very dry in the lecture room. I am now going to attempt to give some idea of the geographical distribution of plants by a Map of the World upon Mercator’s projection 10 or 12 feet square. (for my lectures)</p>
                  <p>I do not know that anything I have said will be of service to you– if not, I beg you will pardon the question I have indulged. Be so good as to inform me how parcels should be addressed to you – whether by London? I shall begin to make up a collection of Cryptogamia for you – In some things I am rich, in others poor; but you shall have all I can spare. In return I shall be glad to receive as many specimens as you please of the rarer Cambridgeshire plants – having numerous correspondents to whom they will be welcome abroad, &amp; in some instances my own Herbarium is deficient. I will send a list of those I wish most in my first parcel.</p>
                  <p>The Crypt. Flora I do hope to be <del>be</del> able to carry on another year at least. But it will cost me some money to do so.</p>
                  <p>I am | Dear Sir | yrs very truly | R K Greville</p>
