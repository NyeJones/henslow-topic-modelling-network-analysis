                  <p>I feel conscious that you must have thought very ill of me for neglecting the Mag. Zool. – but I will explain. Just as I was setting about the Keeling paper in June I received the intimation of my having got a living which took me from Cambridge and I did not return there until October. I then found so much to do and had to wind up my pupilizing affairs with 3 men, that last term I could not look at Darwin’s plants– As soon as I could I prepared the paper but found 2 or 3 points of puzzle &amp; sent it to Sir W. Hooker as Bot. Editor – requesting him to forward specimens for <del>my</del> comparison – I have just heard from him that he can do so, &amp; when I receive them I will immediately send the paper as you may direct me – In future I am happy to say I shall take no pupils &amp; have a clearer field for Botany – I hope to lend a hand at the Annals, but do not propose to ask any remuneration as you offered me under the old work when I could not well spare my time – I think however that I ought to make some allusion to a letter I had from you in which you stated that you would give directions on going to Edinb. (about May last/or before) that I should receive the sum stipulated for my report of the proceedings at Bristol. Now I have never received this, &amp; I fear that there must have been a mistake somewhere – I do not wish to [word illeg.] you &amp; if it was found on winding up the affairs of the Journal that the Editors were loosers I beg that I may not be paid for that Report or <del>for</del> whatever you proposed that I s <hi rend="superscript">d </hi>receive afterwards – but I really think it right that the circumstance s <hi rend="superscript">d </hi>be mentioned – My paper on Keeling will require 2 or 3 outline engravings.</p>
                  <p>Pray say where I am to direct it –</p>
