                  <p>We wish you &amp; yours a happy new year tho’ I hardly know whether you have any of your family with you at present besides Louisa. — Leonard, I suppose, is too far off to have joined your Xmas dinner party, &amp; George too, much taken up with his new wife. — I have just finished Darwin’s book, &amp; should very much like to know what you think of it when you have got through it yourself—. I am not at all indisposed to accept his theory in part, — tho’ perhaps he would say — if in part — how can you refuse to go the whole way with me upon the same reasoning. — I am no stickler for the multitudes of so-called species treated <del>or adopted</del> by so many naturalists of the present day, — &amp; can imagine the Genera, &amp; perhaps families, when perfectly natural, to have originated in a single stock; — but when I think of a Whale or an Elephant by the side of a little mouse &amp; am told they have the same parentage, I stand aghast at the boldness of the assumption: still more if it is attempted to bring together in the same way, (only throwing their beginnings back to a far more remote period of time,) — the vertebrate, annulose, &amp; other leading types of the animal<del>s of</del> kingdom. — To this latter step, &amp; still more to tracing all organised beings to one source there seems to me the objection that does not l<del>y</del> ie against the possibility of <del>one</del> a single class, such as birds, being all modified descendants of some form, viz that there are no connecting limbs, — no intermediate forms, or hardly any, either recent or fossil to be met with. — The existence of man too seems to me the great difficulty of all. I was beginning to think he had passed over this matter entirely, — till almost in the last page I find him saying that his theory “throws light on the origins of men &amp; his history.” — This can only be a civil way of saying that my great, great, &amp;c. &amp;c. grandfather was an oran-outang. — Will this go down with the majority of readers, — do you not feel the dignity of your pedigree thereby impeached? — But soberly, — tho’ I am not one of those who generally mix up scripture &amp; science, I cannot see what sense or meaning is to be attached to Gen. ii, v.7, &amp; especially vs. 21 &amp; 22, — respecting the origin of woman, — if the human species at least is not to be allowed to have had an independent creation, — but to have merely come into the world by ordinary descent from previously existing races of living beings, whatever these latter may be supposed to be! — Neither can I assent to the doctrine that man’s reasoning faculties, — &amp; above all his moral sense, — could ever have been obtained from irrational progenitors, — by mere natural selection acting however gradually, &amp; for whatever length of time that may be required. — This seems to me to be doing away altogether with the divine image, —w. <hi rend="superscript">h</hi> forms the insurmountable distinction between man &amp; brutes.—</p>
                  <p>What severe cold we have had till lately &amp; now what wet: even here, in my sheltered garden, the therm <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> was as low as 15 <hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. — Now we have a flood of water, &amp; the bridge by w. <hi rend="superscript">h</hi> I cross the brook to my parish of Wooley carried away: — I shall have to make a round tomorrow morning to get to Church.</p>
                  <p>My wife joins me in kind love, &amp; many good wishes, to Louisa &amp; yourself. — We are both tolerable.</p>
