                  <p>I have long intended writing to thank you for your great kindness in forwarding to Soho Square the requisite papers in order that I m <hi rend="superscript">t. </hi>be elected a Fellow of the Lin <hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. Society. In June last I rec <hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> the pleasing intelligence of my election: &amp; the reason of my long silence in not thanking you, is that I hoped to have done so in person: a variety of causes have prevented it &amp; one is not the best of health.</p>
                  <p>I was much pleased with your experiment on the seed of the Anagallis reported in the Mag. of N. Hist <hi rend="superscript">y.</hi> .– the result is exactly what I expected. Next year I hope to try the same experiment, &amp; before I sow my seeds, the plant-pots of soil shall be put in a hot-house, lest there should any latent seeds of the red pimpernel, a weed so common in this neighbourhood: I will gladly supply you or any of y <hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Botan <hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> friends with more seed of the red &amp; white.</p>
                  <p>About two months ago, a respected friend, the Rev. J. Harriman of Croft n <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darlington presented me with his valuable Hortus Siccus, contained in 15 vol <hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. 4to. It is an almost complete one. M <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. H. was in extensive correspondence with Sir J. Smith, Dawson Turner, Dalton, Sowerby, Brunton, Winch, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp; the Herbarium is very richly supplied with numerous specimens from these excellent Botanists, &amp; particularly from Sir James. The name of Harriman frequently appears in Smith &amp; Withering &amp; you will find that he was the first to give an English Habitat of the Gentiana verna. <del>In</del> With this unexpected present is a large number of Duplicates from the above Gent <hi rend="superscript">s</hi>., for friends &amp; correspondents; I wish therefore to make you the first offer— so if you think any of them worth accepting, make out a list and I will endeavour, if possible, to send the label in the hand-writing of their respective finders, attached to the plant. M <hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Harriman has not yet forwarded to me his Mosses, Lichens, &amp; Fuci, wch he has kindly promised.</p>
                  <p>I have had your useful Catalogue interleaved, &amp; am making it into an index to my Herbarium. Several of the specimens <del>of</del> you sent me by my friend Green, I find to be extremely rare, &amp; not in M <hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> H's Hort. Sic., these will enhance its value. I think Hooker's Brit. Flora will supersede ere long Sir J. Smith's Eng. Flora. It is an excellent Book, because the descriptions are <hi rend="underline">long</hi> or <hi rend="underline">short</hi>, according as the Characters are prominent or obscure; &amp; the price is not one third of that work. But to me the Eng. Flora is more interesting, having so many specimens gathered by its author.</p>
                  <p>But I will not trespass longer on your time. Be assured <del>that</del> of the continued esteem of | Yours most truly | Edw. Wilson Jun <hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.</p>
                  <p>P.S. I cannot but advert to a most lamentable event wch. has occurred since you were at Wentworth, the unexpected death of Lady Milton: it threw a gloom ove[r] the whole neighbourhood. It is most distressing to witness at Church the Family in the deepest mourning lamenting <del> 
                        <hi rend="underline">illeg name</hi> 
                     </del> one in whom shone every virtue most pre-eminently. I saw that excellent woman at Church the day before her death. Alas! how soon the flower faded &amp; is gone.</p>
