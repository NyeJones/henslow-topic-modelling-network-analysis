                  <p>Delayed by two weddings this morning I did not leave home for the first train as I had intended, &amp; so received your notes &amp; the very interesting account you were so good as to send me – which I read as I walked to the Church &amp; put into my letter box on my return &amp; hope you have received it – I could not help contrasting the difference in general appearance between the two hale and blooming brides I was uniting to their country bridegrooms &amp; the descriptions of the women in the report – In one respect there was a moral or rather immoral resemblance almost universal in county practice – Though our very young women grow up to be good wives &amp; mothers – they will persevere in thinking themselves to their future husbands to an extent which makes our registers sad tell tales or else first children are begotten in a marvelously short time – I think some little improvement has taken place – but we are still grievously below the correct standard – I have no doubt one of our county executions would be a more pleasant party to <hi rend="underline">look at</hi> than such as Mr Brown leads out of the alleys of his parish – but I was much touched with the account of grasping at the first Dog rose – &amp; I think my eyes watered at least a score of times on my journey as I thought of it &amp; since – I shall be truly rejoiced if more of my blackcoated brothers will take up this policy – as you must have found it needs only a certain amount of forbearance &amp; a little experience to obtain success – Experience also will secure the due economy – The visit to one of the 350 from Ipswich was rather more expensive than I should feel justified in repeating annually – but from memoranda made I believe I can reduce it one half &amp; bring it quite within the limits I have been accustomed to allow myself for some sort of annual treat as fireworks &amp;c for some years back – The great thing is to obtain <hi rend="underline">co-operation </hi>&amp; as yet there has been a lack of this – My policy is never to go cap in hand – but to lay down general rules &amp; let volunteers step forward – last year we were 70 &amp; this year 180 – &amp; might have been many more if I had not thought first to draw a line – I am happy to say that I am allowed to rent 16 acres of our feoffment land for allotments – <hi rend="underline">at last</hi> I have allayed opposition though I have not made any converts among the Farmers – When the land was let 9 yrs ago they would not listen to my proposal though I had a list of 60 willing to take the land – last week they consented to allow me to have my way merely stating they were not in favour of the scheme – I shall hope before long to have a Hitcham Prize Show &amp; take a leaf out of your Book in that respect</p>
                  <p>Believe me</p>
                  <p>very truly yours</p>
