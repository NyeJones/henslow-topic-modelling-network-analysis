                    <p>I know nothing of Mr Acton &amp; his collections, further than by report. He is, I believe, a surgeon, &amp; when the railroad was been tunnelled near Ipswich I understand he purchased (at a high price) some large bones. He probably has some good fossils from the Crag also. But I could advise you not to think of purchasing his collection without a personal inspection. Persons located like himself get most exhalted notions of the value of these things, &amp; are generally grievously disappointed when they are told. J. Brown lately left his fossils &amp; shells to Owen (I am one of his executors) but they were not valued for the probate at more than 50£. He had given some of his best things to the British Museum but his relatives &amp; friends (&amp; perhaps himself) were in the habit of fancying wonderful things of what he still retained. Owen is about to have them removed to the British Museum - intending to select what may be really wanted, &amp; divide the rest between Ipswich &amp; Colchester.</p> 
                  <p>Have you seen a good critique on Darwin's Book in the Annals of Natural History for this month? I must say it squares perfectly with my ideas, tho I could not have put them on paper so well. I wrote to Darwin lately expressing my conviction that he had quite over-rated the bearing of his facts &amp; I am writing to him today to say I will pay him a visit next week for  couple of nights &amp; talk the matter over. I have sent a letter to the Athenaeum this week, producing a <hi rend="underline">fact</hi> &amp; asking a <hi rend="underline">question</hi> for tho' I now believe the Celts are in undisturbed Drift I believe it extremely probable that this drift is very recent.</p>
