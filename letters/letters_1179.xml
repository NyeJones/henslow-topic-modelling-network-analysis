                        <p>I feel very much obliged by the trouble you have taken in attending to my request. I fear I am sometimes more importunate than I ought to be in my endeavouring to procure objects for such purposes as the enclosed Programme will tend to explain. As I did not hear from you I determined to postpone my Wasp &amp; Bee lecture for another occasion. The Birds arrived too late for me to unpack them yesterday in the midst of the multitudinous arrangements I had on hand - and today I was obliged to pass 6 1/2 hours in the Justice Room at Hadleigh &amp; have only just opened the box (after post hours). Though I can seldom afford to indulge myself in purchases in Natural history beyond my own <hi rend="underline">natural</hi> line of Botany, I shall be tempted to keep Mr Ledbetter's Birds, &amp; will send him a cheque for them as soon as I can recover his account from amidst the confusion in which the events yesterday have thrown my papers &amp; the whole house. We were fortunate in our day, and every thing went off as we could wish - barring a cold &amp; horseness which prevented my exerting my lungs as I ought. We had a long booth to contain 300 tea drinkers - a small one to contain a model extemporized by my daughters - perhaps as complete a thing of the sort as you ever saw, with its fountain, its flower garden, &amp; cricket field &amp; Marquee &amp;c. Then my Marquee Museum with such specimens as I could command, all properly mounted on stands with several pictures &amp; diagrams in illustration. You would have smiled to see some of my shifts to make things work well - old cotton reels, pasteboard &amp; black varnish on my [text illegible]. Your Bower Bird plates hung up in a conspicuous situation - with half a dozen of your little favourites (their skins, but not stuffed) disposed under a glass case (of home manufacture) &amp; so arranged as living as to display their colours - backed by the views of your Humming Bird house &amp; your portrait as given in the Illustrated London News. Such a medley of things good, &amp; things trumpery (to suit all tastes) you never saw collected under a Marquee! One advantage of such an exhibition is, that it tends to promote natural history among the gentry &amp; clergy, several of whom were present. Next Tuesday I am going to Ld. Henniker's, who has got up a Village Hat Show on the same plan &amp; I am to take him some of my objects to assist at a Marquee Museum - &amp; I hope &amp; trust the plan will spread - it seems to give so much pleasure. Objects you would reject as superfluous or useless I should probably work into something - such is my <hi rend="underline">hobby</hi>. Should I be alive &amp; well next July, when we have our next show, I hope to rig out another Museum of this sort, and shall not scruple to ask all Naturalist friends to lend me a helping hand with whatever odds &amp; ends they can spare. Anything that admits of a <hi rend="underline">tale</hi> being appended to it is most serviceable - but almost anything assists. [text illegible], I exhibited a common <hi rend="underline">Millipede</hi> (as you will see) by the side of a fine large exotic centipede, because one of our Labourers had asked me a fortnight before what was the meaning of the word, he having met with it in a book (he is one of the few that <hi rend="underline">can</hi> read, of the older men) &amp; was puzzled to know whether it was a [text illegible], vegetable, or animal. Though hundreds [text illegible] in the Marquee, nothing was injured. It has taken me nearly a month's hard work to put the materials in train - &amp; I think you would have been surprised at the amount of decorations in laurel wreaths, flowers &amp; [text illegible] prepared by the spontaneous efforts of my family. We all went through as hard a days work as can well be done, &amp; one or two of us were tolerably knocked up, not to say ill. I don't mean myself - for though I was thoroughly fagged with my cold in the head and body &amp; did as much (at least) as any, I bear such matters as well as most. However all went off really well &amp; all dispersed peacefully &amp; happily. Tomorrow I have to put away things &amp; make up accounts &amp; so write at once that I may not longer delay my thanks to you. Among the objects I take to Thornham will be your plates of the Bower Birds which always afford great pleasure. <hi rend="underline">Page 6 read next page first</hi> If I could persuade you to come to one of our shows, I think you would be pleased to see what interest some of our villagers take in inspecting the wonders of a Marquee Museum - though you could not fail to smile at its contents when you remembered what sort of figure they would cut beside any real Museum.</p>
