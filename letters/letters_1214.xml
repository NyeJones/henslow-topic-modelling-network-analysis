                        <p>I am very much obliged to you for thinking of me about the snowflakes &amp; Mezereon but I must give you a little caution not to send such small packets per Coach as the expenses far exceed the value. If you could have got me a good packet, say about <hi rend="underline">100</hi> <hi rend="underline">complete</hi> plants I would willingly have paid for them. I annually receive such a packet of fritillaries from Suffolk. Of course I don't mean that <hi rend="underline">you</hi> shd. be bothered by Digging them up - but my labourer wd. think himself well paid for a shilling or two, where a rare plant <hi rend="underline">abounds</hi> &amp; the expense + carriage is then well worth my while. Where a few only can be got, if you wd. stuff them into some old folio they would dry quite well enough. I hope your Devonshire friend will really not forget to dry me some Lobelia urens this year or send me a <hi rend="underline">good lot</hi> in a tin box if he finds them in sufft. abundance. We shall really be delighted at receiving your proposed edition of insects. They may be sent (as occasion offers) to my Brother's address S. W. H. 12 Clements Inn as he is in the habit of sending me parcels - &amp; they will be quite safe with him till he has one send. You see how prudent a married man is obliged to be. I will take care &amp; return your tin box to Curtis as I suppose you have constant communication with him.</p>
                        <p>Yrs ever sincerely</p>

                        <p>N.B. I don't expect to be in Cambe. after the beginning of July so that no Lobelia sd. be sent after that period</p>
