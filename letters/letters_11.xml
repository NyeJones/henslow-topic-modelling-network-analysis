                  <p>I am afraid that I give you a great deal of trouble in sending you the first fruits of my labours in Scotland; I am just commencing to collect, &amp; have sent you a package which I find very inconvenient to carry with my knapsack, but which I <del>carry</del> fear is hardly worth the carriage to Cambridge; you must not pay the slightest attention to the names I have marked down, many of wch are by guess not always having had a book with me. I wish you would dry <del>them</del> &amp; poison them &amp; if any suit you take what you like. Nothing scarcely is out here, the summer being just in its commencement, the snow not off the mountains &amp; when Gwatkin wanted a pudding yesterday the gooseberry trees were not out of flower. However at present we have spent our time very pleasantly &amp; have enjoyed the scenery very much. Gwatkin is quite a geologist, &amp; discovered a great deal of coal &amp; bituminous matter on the top of Calton Hill in Edinburgh, &amp; it was not until we had framed our hypothesis that we discovered that it was part of the ruin of the bonfire &amp; tar barrel at the king’s last visit to Scotland. I will be much obliged to you to write me word of the arrival or non arrival of the plants, &amp; also any Cambridge news which you have to communicate, &amp; let it be in the post office at Glasgow by the first of July under which expectation I drink your health in Atholl Brose.</p>
                  <p>Your sincere friend | R.Twopeny</p>
