                  <p>The payment must refer to vol.3 of the Collectanea &amp; other Abbé Cochel’s work. Vol. 4 you can pay for when you please; the notice was not meant for you &amp; such as you.</p>
                  <p>You are the only subscriber I have had from the Liverpool meeting!! I never calculated on more than 5 from such a source. Chiefly from my own connections I have now about 180 names.</p>
                  <p>You say you have seen the Collection. I have never yet had the chance of sitting down to it quietly. Some time since when I wanted the MSS, M. <hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Hawkins refused them! –Now however they are with me. I hope you will carefully read over what I have written about the history of this collection. No one has seen it for 40 years, until, (after great pains,) I induced D. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F to grant me access to it.</p>
                  <p>I suppose <del>you</del> now the 3000 people of the Liverpool Meeting are satiated with these remains I may quietly &amp; undisturbedly get to work upon them.</p>
                  <p>I send you an extra circular in case you can enlist any Subscriber.</p>
                  <p>I was sorry I had not the pleasure of seeing you. I came in within 10 minutes after you had left.</p>
                  <p>Believe me, | my dear Sir, | Your’s very sincerely | C. Roach Smith</p>
                  <p>[P.S.] When the B.A.A. could not publish the MSS I offered to do it at my own risk. D. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F. would not consent, saying he had no recollection of ever saying he would allow anyone to do so! See the note of thanks he received from us at Canterbury!!</p>
