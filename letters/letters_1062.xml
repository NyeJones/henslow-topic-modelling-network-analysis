                  <p>The manner in which my name is noticed in a review of Mr. Darwin's work in your number for December, is liable to lead to a misapprehension of my view of Mr. Darwin's "Theory on the Origin of Species." Though I have always expressed the greatest respect for my friend's opinions, I have told himself that I cannot assent to his speculations without seeing stronger proofs than he has yet produced. I send you an extract from a letter I have received from my brother-in-law the Rev. L. Jenyns, the well-known author of "British Vertebrata," as it very nearly expresses the views I at present entertain in regard Mr. Darwin's theory - or rather hypothesis, as I should prefer calling it. I have heard his book styled "the book of the day," on more than one occasion by a most eminent naturalist; who is himself opposed to and has written against its conclusions; but who considers it ought not to be attacked with flippant denunciation, as though it were unworthy consideration. If it be faulty in its general Conclusions, it is surely a stumble in the right direction, and not to be refuted by arguments which no naturalist will allow to be really adverse to the speculations it contains.</p>
                  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
                  <p>J. S. Henslow</p>
                  <p>EXTRACT "I see in <hi rend="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</hi>, you are arranged with Lyell, Hooker, and others in the list of those who have espoused Darwin's views. I was not aware you had become a convert to his theory, and can hardly suppose you have accepted it as a whole, though, like myself you may go the length of imagining that many of the smaller groups, both of animals and plants, may at some remote period have had a common parentage. I do not, with some, say that the whole of his theory cannot be true - but, that it is very far from proved; and I doubt its ever being possible to prove it."</p>
