                  <p>I hope that by this time my answer to your first letter is with you, but I will send a few lines in reply to your second— I am sorry that I cannot go with you to Abbeville, as I have already explained, but I hope you will not find yourself at a loss for guides as M. De Perthes is a host in himself— If he is from home as possibly he may be, you had better enquire for M. Marcotte. Who by the way is great in entomology and natural history [underlined by JSH] — At Amiens I think M. Ferguson fils will put you in the way of seeing every thing— The connexion between the sands of Marchecourt and the gravel of the Champ de Mars &amp; Moulin Quignon — and that between the sands of St Roch and the gravels of St Acheul seem to me points to which your particular attention may be well directed— The existence of similar drift on the opposite side of the valley of the Somme and the absence or presence in it of flint implements is another point that has yet to be cleared up— I find M.<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gunn talks of starting for Switzerland on Monday or Tuesday you had better look out for him— I was in hopes to have got him to show me a part of the Norfolk coast—</p>
                  <p>I am very busy clearing my way for a weeks absence so farewell— a pleasant journey to you— I hope we may meet on your return as I shall be anxious to hear your account of your examination—</p>
                  <p>Yours very sincerely | John Evans.</p>
