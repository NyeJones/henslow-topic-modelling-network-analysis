                  <p>I regret you should have had any trouble respecting the parcel which you were so kind as to forward to me - it seems to have been intended to have been delivered by a friend of Dr Henry's who was to have visited Oxford - but who first forwarded to me by post what should have been his letter of introduction, &amp; then, I know not why, sent the packet through you - I am sorry I did not meet you at Manchester. I have not been able to attend several of the Meetings - being now a family man I am less portable - but I look to these meetings whenever they are held within my reach chiefly as opportunity of meeting old acquaintance. I have heard some rumours that the cycle is to recommence with York &amp; Cambridge. I hope it may be so - as in the present state of Oxford I fear it will require all the stimulus of example from the sister University to drive the spirit shown on the former occasion.</p>
                  <p>Believe me</p>
                  <p>Very many yours</p>
