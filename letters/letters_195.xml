                  <p>I was wrong not to answer your letters containing the account of sale, by return of Post– I was much occupied &amp; fell into a melancholy train of reflections which made me procrastinate from day to day what ought to be have been done at once– Believe me it was from no feeling of dissatisfaction with all that has been done – nothing could have been better arranged, nothing could have been more successful in its way than the sale – I am surprised at the prices the things fetched at least I did not anticipate so large an amount – Thanks to you are out of the question because no profusion of them can ever express a fraction of what we all feel of your goodness judgment &amp; attention–</p>
                  <p>The articles to w. <hi rend="superscript">h </hi>you refer can easily come by and bye–</p>
                  <p>We are much surprised at hearing of Whewell’s resignation of his professorship &amp; there are rumours of his having done it in a feeling of fugue &amp; dissatisfaction. If you think of it when you write next perhaps you will give us more information – but do not put yourself the least out of the way to do so– Mr J. Forbes an enthusiast in Science and an enthusiastic admirer of Whewell’s here, was asking about it &amp; I could give him no information–</p>
                  <p>Am [n]ow busy preparing for my catechetical class – I take great pleasure in this part of my duty &amp; found my young people much interested &amp; very attentive – I have been chasing up a catechism in the liturgy – not being able to find one w. <hi rend="superscript">h</hi> w. <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> answer my purpose – do you know if there is such a thing well done–</p>
                  <p>Believe me yours | most truly &amp; affectionately | E. B. Ramsay</p>
