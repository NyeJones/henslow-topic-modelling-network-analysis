                  <p>I am ashamed of not having sooner acknowledged your letter of the 10. <hi rend="superscript">th </hi>inst enclosing some impressions of coins, but my time has been so much occupied the last few weeks that I have really had no other course left than to neglect some of my private correspondence—And now with regard to the impressions for which I am much obliged—The first is of a base groat of Henry VIII[.] Viz that found in the old farmhouse—The 2. <hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> of Charles II is merely a jetton or counter as the word “Becherpfennig” on the reverse sufficiently testifies—The touch-pieces were always of gold. The third is also a counter of the time of Louis XIV and struck by the same manufacturer of counters as that of Charles II viz—Conrad Lauffer who belonged to a jetton manufacturing family at Nuremberg, of whom Wolfgang Lauffer was I think the first—Nearly all the counters for the supply of all the Abacuses of Europe were made at Nuremberg &amp; when Arabic notation &amp; Cocker &amp; Record came in, counters went out or were only retained for use at cards</p>
                  <p>I have given orders for a roll of paper to be prepared for your diagrammatic work; so do not be surprised at seeing a long parcel make its appearance—I beg your acceptance of it and hope that you may find it such as will answer your purpose—M. <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Evans desires to be remembered to you &amp; I remain</p>
                  <p>My dear Sir | yrs very truly | John Evans</p>
                  <p>I am afraid I must add that the coins are of no appreciable value.</p>
