                        <p>I have received some drawings of a new fossil allied to Stigmaria, from Mr Teal of the Phil. Soc. Leeds, &amp; a communication from Mr Bowman &amp; one or two others. When your arrangements are made for recommencing the Flora, I will prepare such an account of these objects as may seem to be worth inserting. I feel the want of <hi rend="underline">named</hi> specimens - for I find, in some cases that it is impossible to feel quite sure of several species which I suppose I have before me. If I could once see a few of these, many doubts would clear away. I have satisfied myself about 2 or 3 errors that have crept into Sternbergh &amp; Brongniart &amp;c. Both have mistaken Artis's figure of Calamites nodosus, &amp; Brongniart has <hi rend="underline">improved</hi> the figure in his copy to suit his fancy. What Artis intends to represent broken tubercles on the upper ends of the costae Brongniart figures as distinct <hi rend="underline">interpolated</hi> costae! &amp; Sternbergh places the species in his first section instead of in the 2d. By &amp; large these 2 sections of Sternbergh are idle, after what Brongniart says on the subject, &amp; what is clearly the fact. I suspect Artis's C. nodosus (Brongts. ramosus) to be merely a branch bearing joint of his C. decoratus. I think also that the curved extremities considered by some as the summits &amp; by others as the bases of stems, are in reality the bases of branches thus - [illustration] The size of some does not seem to be too great for the larger species - your collections are always desired to work out sharp[?] for <hi rend="underline">junctions</hi> of leaves &amp; stems, or stems &amp; branches, however imperfect the specimen - they will serve the cause much more than by merely selecting handsome looking specimens. If you have any Calamites to figure, I think it might be done in the first No. &amp; I could refer to the corrections &amp; one or two other suggestions that I should wish to make.</p>
