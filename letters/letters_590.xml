                  <p>Many thanks for y. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> letter. I have already received from the Labourers friend Soc. such papers as they have relating to allotments. Some years ago I was a member of the Committee of that Society, but not being at the time particularly interested in allotments, I had overlooked it as a source of information.</p>
                  <p>I had a tolerably good day for my show, it was however rather cloudy, and the wind was high enough to damage the nosegays. I had as usual among the regular produce many strange things shown. One farmer exhibited a very fair plant of Dioscorea Batalas with a root weighing probably a quarter of a pound. Another showed a large pumpkin on which were engraven some verses from Jonah, an inscription of perhaps rather doubtful propriety. The whole show was excellent, but I have not yet got up the statistics of it— indeed my people are in such a state of anxiety and excitement before and during the show, that an equivalent state of collapse follows and I can neither get anything done for a few days, nor can I hear all that transpired at the show. When I have got the usual document printed I will send it to you. Potatoes were not so good this year as last. The epithet which I heard the people applying to them was “Scabby”— a word which described accurately enough the outward appearance of them.</p>
                  <p>Onions, carrots turnips and parsnips appeared to improve, indeed there appears to be a progressive improvement[.] One farmer dug a pit eight feet deep on purpose to grow some Mangold in for the show I did not oppose this— though it was scarcely fair— hoping that he might discern the general advantage of deep cultivation.</p>
                  <p>My Wellingtonias planted out grow most vigorously—and promise to be a grand addition to our forest trees</p> 
                  <p>Believe me |yours very truly | Ducie</p>
