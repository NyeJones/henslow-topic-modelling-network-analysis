                  <p>I had your first note but as I expected Mr Sclater here in a day or two I did not reply until he came, your other note came last night – and the Slip of the birds is now returned with one or two alterations—Mr Sclater has taken Gray’s arrangement as one accessible &amp; used in the Br. Mus. &amp; whatever one’s own Ideas may be it is perhaps better for your purposes to take a published system than to draw up an M.S. one according to particular views—The actual or original type also is sometimes sacrificed to introduce one from the British list—the Plates for reference can scarcely be introduced here from want of references, when printed if you will send me a copy I shall add the references to good figures when I get home, &amp; which will serve you on any other occasion. I have not made any remarks on the other parts of the proof as you mention having received the proof sheets.</p>
                  <p>We have been here since November but return to J. Hall about the end of next month—address here for a month and believe me</p>
                  <p>very sincerely yours | Wm Jardine</p>
                  <p>My note to you from Glasgow was written hurriedly. I don’t recollect what was therein. I suppose I addressed Cambridge as a certain find not having my address book with me</p>
