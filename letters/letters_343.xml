                  <p>Thanks for your note. Your Servant drove me admirably; so I did very well, tho’ we had not so much talk as you &amp; I might perhaps have kept up. Next day I called on the Marchesa who will I think come sometime with Maggie to see you; &amp; the <del>next</del> 
                     <add>following</add> day I called on Leonard – but he was flown away I found – I also have had a very lazy chat with a very old Lady, who lives on the N. side of Parker’s Piece, &amp; who was rejoiced to have news of your family. Nor is this all my weeks work – Twice have I called on Fanny at Stapleford &amp; both times she was out walking: but she is waxing plump &amp; cosy I hear. Considering that I am not a calling man, this is I think very exemplary &amp; wonderful &amp; lest you &amp; M. <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Henslow should not butter me for it I will butter myself – I have written to D <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke to tell him I will take two copies of John M [illeg]’s book – The cost will be 10/0.– Pray lay the sum down for me – No! That is not worth while perhaps; for I may send a P.O. order. What nearly ready for the Press may mean I hardly know – I have a book in the Press &amp; it has been advertised as nearly ready for about three years. It ought to be a full grown chicken after such an incubation. I was yesterday at a dinner in honor of Cuvier. It rose <del>out of</del> out of a bet, &amp; was given by D. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher – I left them at half past eleven making speeches. I suspect they are still speaking; for I have seen none of them today. M <hi rend="superscript">.rs</hi> Henslow is I trust gradually recovering from the effects of my Sermon Give my love to her, a kiss from me to my Goddaughter – &amp; a merry Xmas to the lads</p>
