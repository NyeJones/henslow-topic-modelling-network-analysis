                    <p>I tried to get at you yesterday, but was told you were out of Cambridge. As Tuesday is May 1. I suppose you will be back again. Livering  informs me I am combined with you in the form of a sub-committee to organise a 2.S. for the geological portion of the Nat. Sc. Tripos. Of course <hi rend="underline">you</hi> must concoct the scheme &amp; expound it more, &amp; if I can assist I will do so. I have sent in my Botanical scheme, &amp; rather think you are the only one who is now left to bring up the rear. In a letter from Lyell on Friday he says Prestwick &amp; Murchison have returned from Amiens &amp; that they consider the Celt-Drift "on the <hi rend="underline">elevation</hi>" cotemporaneous with Drift at the bottom of the valley. If this be so, there is an end of the <hi rend="underline">vast</hi> antiquity of this Drift - as the valley must have pre-existed, &amp; not have been scooped out subsequently to its deposition. But <hi rend="underline">then</hi> we must have a <hi rend="underline">Catachlism</hi> (sic) &amp; that Lyell must agree to. He urges me to examine into the point with all possible care. I had expected to have started on June 4th for Amiens with Louisa, but I have received an intimation that the Royal children want a Botanical Salad, after the Zoological repast which Owen has been giving them - &amp; that most probably I shall be asked to concoct 3 or 4 lectures for them in June. Sir Jas Clark has written, &amp; I have expressed myself willing if times &amp; seasons prove agreeable.</p>
