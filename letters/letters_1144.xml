                        <p>I was obliged to leave my house on business early this prenoon and I therefore write from the Athenaeum.</p>
                        <p>Most gladly would I, personally or by advice, aid you in [text illegible] note of the 5h. refers to: the more so because I [text illegible] 'spirited young lad' to be your own son.</p>
                        <p>I have no interest whatever that way. I mean on the line of Indian appointments with the Directors of the E.I. Company. It would be an ungrateful affectation in me, were I to say, I had not an [text illegible] on a recent occasion had proof of their willingness to listen to my recommendation in matters connected with Indian science and the like. And alas - an old the oldest friend in the Direction, M. Genl Caulfeild &amp; I see in today's Times he has just died</p>
                        <p>Your plan would [be] I should think - to apply to some Director at once - provided you have any acquaintance or friend among them. If you happen to know Col Sykes he would be the more likely [text illegible] to a request coming from you because he is attached to scientific pursuits amoong others to Botany. Dr Royle may perhaps befriend the lad - especially no doubt in case my [text illegible] is right. At least Royle might powerfully back your application. Each Director has yearly a certain number of Cadetships at his disposal, and strong personal interest would assuredly obtain a nomination for their candidate. If you have no direct interest with any of those gentlemen, I dare say there are, among your circle of friends, those that have. Get any such to apply and the thing is done. And yet - I will not deny it - a Cadetship, in fact any [text illegible] nomination to the Company's service (the Army - the medical as well as clerical service) is so highly prized in these times of profound peace, that only strong interest is likely to secure an appointment.</p>
                        <p>Would that I could be of service to you, [text illegible] truly proud and happy would I be. But, alas, a hearty wish is all I can offer in token of my cordial respect and intents towards you.</p>
                        <p>Believe me,</p>
                        <p>My Dear Sir</p>
                        <p>Yours sincerely</p>
