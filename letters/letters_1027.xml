                  <p>You will I have no doubt be very sorry to learn that Mr Webster is in a state of <hi rend="underline">great</hi> pecuniary difficulty from very indifferent health. I write these lines at home, with the intention of adding to them in London tomorrow, and I wish much to have your opinion &amp; assistance as to the best mode of doing something for Webster, - if you think, as I do, that he has strong claims upon the kind, &amp; just, feelings of the Geological Society.</p>
                  <p>My information upon the subject comes from Mr Darwin. It has been confirmed by what I learned yesterday in London &amp; I now keep this letter open for the purpose of adding what I learn tomorrow when I intend to make further enquiries upon this subject.</p>
                  <p>It occurred-, at once, to some of us who talked over the matter on Wednesday evening, at the Geological Society, that a small <hi rend="underline">pension</hi> if it can be obtained, - would be the best, - as it is obviously the most <hi rend="underline">acceptable form</hi> of relief, to a man in W's strictures, and he is not without claims to the <hi rend="underline">public</hi> notice, such grounds with which you are well acquainted. These of course cannot be compared to the claims of <hi rend="underline">Smith</hi> - <hi rend="underline">Dalton</hi> - &amp;c - but with reverence to most of the names upon the (hitherto) pension-list - Webster would have great advantage:- And it will be very easy, - if the Cambridge members of our society think well, to suggest &amp; [text illegible] <hi rend="underline">Mr Spring Rice</hi>, -  to obtain a statement in memorial with very good signatures, from members of the Geological &amp; Bryol. Societies, in W's favor</p>
                  <p>Pray think of this, &amp; oblige me with a few lines:- I shall write at the same time to Sedgwick (though I fear he may be at Norwich) &amp; to our President Mr Whewell.</p>
                  <p>My dear sir very sincerely yours</p>
                  <p>Wm. Henry Fitton</p>
                  <p>P.S. [text illegible] Sedgwick I learn is at Norwich:- and I have sent my letter to that place. What I could learn today about W. confirms what I have mentioned above - &amp; makes me imagine that he wants <hi rend="underline">immediate</hi> help:- even if we should obtain a small pension. His lectures have failed of late:- &amp; I believe he has no resources but drudgery for the booksellers. We shall have on Wednesday next, at our geological meeting, a good opportunity of collecting opinions, - &amp; perhaps you would write to me before that day.</p>
                  <p>I am pleased to find that some [text illegible} I should grieve if he were to end his days in misery.</p>
