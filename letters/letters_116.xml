                  <p>Yesterday’s Post brought me your Desiderata, &amp; accompanying note: for it, &amp; your kind intentions, accept my cordial thanks.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to what I had ventured to hope, I can be of some little use to you:– though many of your wants, are, also, my own. I am surprised to see some of your very near neighbours in the List– such as Artemisia Campestris (most abundant about Thetford) &amp; Caucalis latifolia, which I, once, saw growing on the road from Newmarket to London – about a mile beyond the Devil’s Ditch. It left me with the Herbarium, for York. You appear to be carrying on a very brisk ver-fou, Dear Sir; a circumstance enviable enough. My correspondents are so few, that my zeal is, occasionally, much cooled:– but of all pursuits Dear Botany dispels the gloom of solitude the best. My spirit of communication is fervent; &amp; I agree with you, fully, in thinking that, though it be delightful both to give &amp; to receive, the former is preferable, of the two. I will do my best in your service, &amp; am, really obliged to you for the agreeable engagement you have laid me under. Hooker’s Flora I am anxiously expecting: but can almost lament that some very material Genera will be done by another hand. That hand is, understandably, a very able one, Mr. Borrer: but I think more <hi rend="underline">species </hi>will be allowed by <hi rend="underline">him</hi>, this w. <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have been the case had the hydra of Botany –Ribes– Rosa &amp; Salix been subjected to the sword of the Glasgow Professor, who w. <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have cut off some of the heads, instead of granting them a licence to live &amp; multiply. I am far from meaning to disparage Borrer, whom I know &amp; admire, not only as a most accurate Botanist, but as a liberal &amp; kind Friend: all I w. <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> insinuate, is, that <hi rend="underline">his</hi> eyes are so much more acute than my own, that I cannot always follow him in his investigations &amp; decisions.</p>
                  <p>Have you seen Greville’s Algae Britannicae? I have the Book, but am not Algologist enough to decide upon its merits.</p>
                  <p>The nomenclature of Botany has now grown into a very arduous study – I could, almost, as readily learn that, as the 400,000 characters of the Chinese vocabulary. For the rising generation of Botanists, I have no doubt all this will be gain: but Decandolle, Brown &amp; C <hi rend="superscript">o</hi> have thrown a wet blanket over us, old superannuated chaps, which few of us will be able to exist under. Have you Lycoperdon fornicatum (Geastrum of Greville)? If not, I can send you a good specimen.</p>
                  <p>Dear Sir,|very truly yours|Ja. <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> Dalton</p>
                  <p>[P.S.] Our mutual Friend Macfarlen talks of a trip to old alma mater. I wish he may be able to prevail upon you to try the air of Yorkshire, &amp; the Side-boards of Yorkshire &amp; the Cellars of D <hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. Mac is as friendly, kind hearted man as exists.–</p>
