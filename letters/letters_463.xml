                  <p>I forward the proof of your questions, and am glad that you were saved from the blunder of coming up for a wrong day. You will see, on looking at the Calendar, that though there is room to put in the subject of the Examination in some places, there is not in others, on account of two Exam. <hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> falling on the same day. The days and subjects are all marked in the Scheme which is printed for each year, and which you either have or ought to have.</p>

If you will name a day for dining with me (in the Hall, which is the only way I can ask a friend in Session Time) I will try &amp; get our little club together again to meet you.</p>
                  <p>I have just got a second Paper forthcoming on the Foraminifera; and I am putting together my materials for a third, in which I shall delight Jos. Hooker’s heart in smashing no end of genera and species, and shall work out completely the structure of Nummulite from recent types.

Believe me to be</p>
