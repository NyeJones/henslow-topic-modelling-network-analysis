                  <p>I beg your pardon for giving such unintelligible &amp; deficient information about the votes, but I will try to make myself more clear. I meant to write Maltby not Malkin. E. H. Maltby you will find as an M.A. I believe in the last calendar. He is of Pembroke, son of the Dr. M. He said he did not know whether his father had given a promise to Ld.P. from him or not, so that you may put him down if not there already. C. Evans is of Pembroke also &amp; a fellow. He is a provincial barrister practising at Norwich where he resides. He said the candidates had not found out his residence as he has only been there a year, or not so long. Bankes called on him, but he was not at home.</p>
                  <p>I hope this will be sufficient for your purpose.</p>
                  <p>Pray has there been a box coat (which belongs to my father) sent to your house from the Bull Inn in Trumpington St. which I directed the landlord to deposit at your house. If he has not sent it, would you be so good as to let James call for it &amp; if he gets it in time send it back by the carriage tomorrow.</p>
                  <p>I am afraid I shall not have time to call in the morning in my way to London. I shall hope to send you some more votes in the course of a few days.</p> 
                  <p>Farewell - &amp; believe me</p> 
                  <p>yrs - sin</p> 
                  <p>C. Jenyns</p> 
                  <p>'I have asked Richard to get my coat &amp; broke the seal'</p>
                  <p>Maltby's address is New Square Lincolns Inn - I forget the number</p>
