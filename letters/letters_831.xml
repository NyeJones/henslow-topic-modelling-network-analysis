                  <p>I was very much obliged to you for your kind letter, and sit down to say, that I shd feel myself accordingly obliged to you, not to mention to anybody, but to Lord Palmerston, that I have in the least interested myself about his Lordship. I have a most particular reason, for wishing this. I have thro' the father in law of Dr Lamb asked his vote, and I wish you to inform me, what he has done - I have also applied thro' another channel - but keep all this <hi rend="underline">mum</hi>. You say you are Professor, but you do not exactly tell me of what, therefore I beg you, to be so good, as to inform me, "<hi rend="underline">tout suit</hi>". You give one kind of a hint, that you are Professor of Botany, but I am not quite certain as to that matter. I have always wished very much, to attend some botanical lectures, but I have never been in any place where there has been any going on, so that all my botany, is from my own idea on the subject, I therefore wish, that you wd be so kind, as to find me a list of books, you would advise me to read on Botany. I have latterly, been fortunate enough, to obtain a plant, called Salvia splendens, which I admire very much. If you have any new plants, I beg you send me some of the seeds. If I go to France this year, <hi rend="underline">I shall send you </hi> some. The Shyzanthus porrigens (sic), of course you have got, as also the Commelina coelestis. I wish for some seeds of a poppy whose name I do not know, but its appearance, is nearly this - it has a very bright scarlet blossom, with a blank eye, and the leaf is like the horned, or sea poppy, and it bears the seed in the same way. Now if you could send me the name of this fellow, and also send me some of the seed, I shd. feel exceedingly obliged to you. I was very sorry to hear, from the Isle of Mann lately, that Mrs Stewart is very ill, a circumstance that gives me great concern. I suppose, you are aware, that both Miss Smith, and Charlotte Smith are dead, poor dear souls! I was very sorry for their suffering. I think they both died from living in the Isle of Mann and I am confident, that my illness, was brought on, by that detestable climate. I find that Juke has not sold all his property in the Isle of Mann nor does he intend it - but what he is to do with the house I cannot make out unless he intends to let it off in flats, like the houses in Scotland. Poor dear Vick! I hope she was near you when she died, I am at present very anxious about my poor favourites left in the Isle of Mann.</p>
                  <p>I cannot help again entreating you, to think [it] my duty, if you can be of any use to Mr Robert Murrays son Robert, anything you could think of, but has to do with books would do. I beg my best respects, to Mrs Henslowe (sic) and every good wish to the little strangers. Pray is it true, that Purby is become a <hi rend="underline">Saint.</hi> 
                  </p>
                  <p>Yours very sincerely</p>
                  <p>J. H. Stapleton</p>
                  <p>We are delayed here, owing to Lord Stirling business, but, I think, you had better send your letter to Netherton House near Worcester and enclose to my brother - Mereworth Castle near Tunbridge Kent - farewell!</p>
