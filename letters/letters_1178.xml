                        <p>There is nothing like going direct to headquarters for a little information, &amp; I would thank you much to inform me what would be likely to be the cost of stuffed specimens of the Bee-eater &amp; Honey Buzzard?</p>
                        <p>On Sept 28 I have to make a little village demonstration in Natural History &amp; propose giving a Lecturet or two on Bees and Wasps of which I have nests &amp; specimens. I should much like to exhibit the above named Birds as connected with the history of these insects, &amp; if not over costly for such an occasion to purchase them for after reference by those who may be disposed to enquire. If you can put me on the right scent for any additional materials of this sort that may be generally interesting I shall feel much obliged. I have an attic filled with miscellaneous objects of natural history which I bring out on occasion for the sake of interesting my neighbours. Some of us are hunting up the Land &amp; Freshwater Molluscs of the village against the 28th. If the birds are expensive would it be too much to ask the <hi rend="underline">loan</hi> of them for a few days? I shall be in town on the 10th &amp; through (back) on the 13th, &amp; could carry them myself with care &amp; (if not too long a loan) could bring them back when I come up again in Nov. 18 - otherwise I cd. receive them by train &amp; return them within a week.</p>
