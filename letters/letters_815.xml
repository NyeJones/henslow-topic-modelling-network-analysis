                  <p>A thousand thanks for your list, newspaper &amp;c and, pray congratulate no. 119 for me.</p>
                  <p>I expected you would have been able to send up to us Greenwood of Caius - as you have not done so, you must be contacted to take him from me, who received him together with Evans of Pembroke (doubtfully mentioned in your yesterday's list) from George Jenyns. Apropos of him, he is to charge me with the care of a watch for someone of your Bottisham friends, and is to send it to my lodging, tomorrow.</p>
                  <p>Your hint about John Beverley will be attended to; but to find him will be difficult enough in so wide a street as Fleet Street especially as he (no doubt snugs it in some busy parlour) unless you send some more specific information touching the number of the house.</p>
                  <p>We shall sooner or later bag some of the Queens men in your list through the Grants, who have already written to two or three of them</p>
                  <p>You will oblige me by making Merrick tell my nephew that there is no change in my plan, and that I wish him to bespeak my usual loaf for Friday.</p>
                  <p>Our places are taken in the Telegraph.</p>
                  <p>ever yrs</p>
                  <p>Dear Henslow,</p>
                  <p>with respectful compliments to the Master,</p>
                  <p>Carrighan, A.</p>
                  <p>Peacock has just dropped in, but brings us no news. Till he arrived, the noble Lord and myself had it all to ourselves</p>
