                  <p>I thank you for the Reports which are very satisfactory, &amp; I am glad to see that Miss Richardson gives so much satisfaction. I shall send the reports to our Master at Highgate, &amp; will recommend him to consider whether to any extent your example can be followed there. The Committee of Council would do a great good if they sent 100 copies of your reports to every one of their Inspectors for distribution. There is nothing like an example! – If any thing comes in my way the least likely to contribute to your collection of useful objects I will bear you in mind.</p>
                  <p>We came back a week ago and are likely to remain; so if you should come to town you are pretty sure to find us - &amp; you know, I hope, how glad we should be to see you.</p>
                  <p>If Lyell returns from Yorkshire tomorrow, as the Pertz’s are here from Berlin, and the Bunbury’s from Mildenhall, Mrs Horner &amp; I will sit down to dinner tomorrow with our six daughters and our four sons in law, with the addition of our three grandsons at dessert – a joy and blessing to my wife and me, for which we cannot be too grateful to God. The Bunburys are on their way to Malvern-</p>
                  <p>The Glasgow Meeting appears to have gone off capitally. Darwin enjoyed it much I hear. I have heard nothing of Hooker; suppose he is in Germany and M <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hooker with you-</p>
                  <p>Give our kind regards to all your house &amp; believe me</p>
                  <p>faithfully yours</p>
                  <p>Leonard Horner</p>
                  <p>I see you have changed your post town-</p>
