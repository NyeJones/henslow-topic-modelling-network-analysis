                  <p>James Stephen’s determination to give certificates to persons who had not taken out Lecture Tickets was met with very strong remonstrances on my part, but in vain. As he had not entered into the agreement into which the other certifying Professors entered, not to give Certificates without that condition, he stands upon a different footing from the rest: and I believe that practically speaking, very few persons have taken advantage of this rule. Almost all his auditors have taken out Lecture Tickets and paid for them. Still there is an obvious inconsistency in the present state of things.</p>
                  <p>I have done my best to bring the Professors and the University into cooperation and have, it seems to me, to a certain extent succeeded: in spite of great difficulties; of which I may say, that the persuadence of Professors is an action most considerable. If any other person will try to amend the scheme, I shall be glad to support him, as I do not think that I shall originate anything of that kind. I find it hard enough to prevent the whole scheme being frustrated.</p>
                  <p>Mrs Whewell is very far from well but is I hope improving. My kind regards to Mrs Henslow.</p>
                  <p>Yours very truly</p>
