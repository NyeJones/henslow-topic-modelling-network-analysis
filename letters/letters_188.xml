                  <p>I am very much obliged to you for listing to me the particulars of poor Ramsay’s death. The report reached me at Birmingham on my way home, through Thackeray, <add>where I met him</add>, &amp; though it was too circumstantial to admit of much doubt I could not help clinging to the hope that it might be false till the newspaper &amp; then your letter <add>which was sent after me</add> put an end to all doubt of the melancholy truth – I believe none of us will feel this great loss so deeply as you will, I hope we may any of us bear it as well &amp; as much like Christian men as I know you will To me the blank his departure leaves is so very painful a one that I have hardly yet trusted myself to dwell on the thought of it. We were united by so many common pursuits &amp; … &amp; I owe to him so much of what was good &amp; agreeable at Cambridge that I cannot hope my personal loss will now be repaired to say nothing of so abrupt &amp; unlooked for a close to long habits of intercourse &amp; friendship which was continually becoming more intimate– But we may not confine our regret for a man like Ramsay to the loss we ourselves feel of his society - &amp; of his many admirable qualities or to our own private grief at being parted for a time at least from a dear &amp; valued friend: The university; &amp; indeed society at large can ill spare such men: in very few shall we find such a body of real worth, such an unpretending fulfillment of duty, so kindly &amp; social a spirit, so much of the strength which is in quietness &amp; confidence[.] I have long looked on his character with admiration, &amp; with increasing admiration, because I could perceive continual improvement by patient self discipline &amp; by the faithful use of associated means - Others may not have been so clearly aware of this but I have no doubt that you who have known him longer &amp; more intimately than I have are still more convinced of its truth.</p>
                  <p>And it must lighten our grief – for though we see with sorrow &amp; at first with a sort of painful surprise a source of much substantial good &amp; of much innocent enjoyment to very many, so suddenly cut off yet then a light breaks through the cloud &amp; we may perhaps in this case see though darkly what we do in all most undoubtedly believe, that so it is best <add>both</add> for him &amp; for us. That it is so for him requires no effort of faith to feel assured of. God grant that we may fulfil his fatherly intentions to his word &amp;<add>make it so for ourselves</add> by submitting in a childlike spirit to Him &amp; to all his other dispensations even though they should be still more painful to our human feelings – so I would pray to feel – but I am conscious of infinite weakness &amp; I positively dread returning to Cambridge where the forceful associations will renew the sense of loss at every turn. Indeed I must confess though will firstly say this argues anything but patience that my first strong impulse was not to return at all.</p>
                  <p>I hope M. <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Henslow is now well again &amp; that you have been led to think too depressingly of your brother. Pray remember me very kindly to her &amp; give a kiss to little Fanny &amp; Louisa</p>
                  <p>Ever My Dear Henslow | your affectionate Friend | W. Worsley</p>
                  <p>[P.S.] Since leaving Bowood where we spent two months agreeably &amp; I hope not altogether unprofitably I made a little tour on my way into Yorksh. Whither your letter followed me-</p>
