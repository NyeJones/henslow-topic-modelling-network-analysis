                  <p>I want you to set me right about some asserted marvel in vegetable physiology. A neighbour of mine tells me that he has made the experiment of sowing oats in the autumn and cutting them as they spring up twice or thrice, and that they have, by this process, such of the plants as survived become barley. I suppose you have heard of this experiment as it has been asserted in several popular books that barley or rye is the result of such an operation. My neighbour is now to repeat the trial this year, and also to sow the barley which he has thus got. Thus I should like to know whether you botanists have any faith in the change, and what precautions you would suggest to make the trial as clear as possible.</p>
                  <p>The same gentleman has planted the corn of an ear of mummy wheat, and has obtained an extraordinarily large produce. Have you heard anything of the result of the like trials? I am told that the wheat is the same as the modern Egyptian Wheat . Is this so? The ear is very different from our wheat; – awned and shaped like a bunch of grapes.</p>
                  <p>I had a kind note from Mrs Henslow the other day which I have not yet acknowledged. Is she returned to you from Brighton? I hope, whether, or not, that she is much improved in health. Pray give my kind regards to her– and also Mrs Whewell’s and to the girls. Is there any chance of seeing you in these parts.</p>
                  <p>I am, my dear Henslow, | always sinly yours, | W Whewell</p>
