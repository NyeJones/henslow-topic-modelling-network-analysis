                  <p>According to your letter I mentioned your request to Mr Hughes &amp; was enabled to show him a list of Kentish votes, a copy of a list which you sent my father &amp; by him forwarded to me - it appears that your University Election has already been the subject of his thoughts &amp; conversation - &amp; that he feels decidedly hostile to Lord Palmerstons success on account of his support of the Catholics, and does not fancy appearing to canvass for him - i.e. with the voters opinions - &amp; more particularly speak to Sir R.K. whose opinion on the Catholic Question is so well known. Mr H. mentioned 2 whom he knew had refused to support Lord P. Wharton &amp; Whitehead of Sevenoaks - the latter was canvassed by Lord Camden - however when he has an opportunity he shall ascertain the intentions of those he can.</p>
                  <p>Why I most assuredly must have given you to understand, altho' probably I might not have mentioned it - that a similar stamp receipt, signed by you, would be required to enable me to procure your salary quarterly - a receipt quarterly of course - you can use your own discretion how many you will send up - &amp; according to opportunity etc.</p>
                  <p>Pray give my compts to Harriet &amp; love to the young ones &amp; believe me</p>
