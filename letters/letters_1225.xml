                        <p>In poking about here to see what I might see I want a little instruction from you - as I find you examined a large clay pit here. What is your notion of it? It seems to me to exhibit a great fault - one side being composed of Oxf. Clay (?) &amp; the other a mess of mud &amp; debris from the Chalk down to the same clay. This sort of debris I have always considered as marking the country about Bourne &amp; the neighbourhood where numerous fossils are found - but as I conceive none of them in situ. Yesterday I got well ducked 3 or 4 times in walking to Upware to look at some <hi rend="underline">stone pits</hi> laid down in the mass &amp; was surprised &amp; puzzled at what I saw. I expected fully to find the lower chalk or clunch, but it seems to me that the character of this rock very closely resembles some of the Portland beds. Do you know anything of these pits. The Geology of this flat fenny country is so obscure that I shall be glad of any hint or suggestion you may have to make. I stay here about 10 days longer &amp; sd be obliged by an immediate answer though I can of course repeat any visit, if it seems worth while. I find you paid a visit to the Adam &amp; Eve in my sisters room on the day we excursionized in our barge down the river. I am sorry I was not here to entertain you. I hope Mrs Buckland is thoroughly recovd of her attack. I shall send all the Darwin bones to Clift who has written for them to figure &amp; mend</p>
