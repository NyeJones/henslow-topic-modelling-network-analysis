                    <p>Few things w. <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> give me more delight than to pay you a visit—lectures included— &amp; I know &amp; feel, that if I had not been <hi rend="underline">ordered </hi>to Hastings, it w.d have done me more good than any thing else, to have been home idle with you &amp; Calvert for a few weeks— The truth is that I have had a good deal to wrong me of late— &amp; what with my mothers death &amp; various other anxieties, I have had rather a climax of troubles within the last few months— I presume the partial paralysis of some of the nerves brought on <del>last</del> Jan. <hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1839 either by a severe chill or by sleeping for some weeks in a house full of fresh paint &amp; painters, has by degrees extended itself to other parts of the system, &amp; that the increasing ill health I have felt lately, has been in <del>great</del> great measure sympathetic with the decayed nerves— All this has been made worse by worry— &amp; therefore I anticipate considerable advantage from shaking the dust off my shoes against the door of this place &amp; picking up shells at S. <hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Leonards.</p>
                  <p>I hope to get away on Thursday next or at all events on Friday-- &amp; to be absent about 3 weeks—</p>
                  <p>All this will prevent me going as I ought to do to Westmorland— &amp; therefore I shall be obliged to take the 5 days holiday at Whitsuntide for that purpose— so that I see no prospect whatever of getting any further absence from my work during the remainder of the Summer— [rest of letter missing]</p>
