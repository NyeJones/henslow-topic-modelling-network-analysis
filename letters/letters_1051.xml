                  <p>I send you a sequel to what you had before. I had it in my pen to refer to a hasty remark I made in one of my letters - as I felt after it was gone it might have an ungracious &amp; perhaps canting appearance to you. But you rather startled me by an expression of my "good works" to which I felt I had no claim. I feel very deeply indebted to you for the kind manner in which you assisted in repelling the very false imputation laid upon me last year by a reporter in the Times. It was very friendly of you &amp; I am not insensible to good report - but I fear it at least as much as bad report, <hi rend="underline">when not merited</hi>. So pray do not suppose that I wanted to be snappish, though I confess the manner in which I expressed myself may have had that appearance. I hope you understand me, indeed I am sure you do - so I will say no more. If you disagree with me in any of the principles I endeavour to enforce do not hesitate to do so - &amp; I will always try to see where I am wrong.</p>
                  <p>Ever sincerely Yrs</p>
                  <p>J. S. Henslow</p>
