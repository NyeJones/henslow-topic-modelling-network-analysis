                  <p>My long silence must have appeared to you quite inexplicable –the fact is that ever since I received your kind letter of the 15. <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> May, I have been utterly in want of leisure, and could not attend to correspondents without prolonging the delay, already too great, in the preparation of the sets of Mosses which they expected from me months ago –I have worked hard for a long time on these sets, but have only just completed the first ten sets, each containing 450 packets consisting of 404 specs with varieties –the task has been much more arduous than I anticipated—</p>
                  <p>Your set is now quite ready; but I think it best to ask how you would wish it to be sent – I have a similar set ready for C.C. Babington Esq. <hi rend="superscript">re</hi> &amp; both might be sent under one cover to Cambridge; or shall I forward yours to M <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webb Esq <hi rend="superscript">re</hi> in London for you? – It makes no difference to me—</p>
                  <p>I was very sorry not to have been so fortunate as to see you when you were in Warrington – I had no time to spare when I passed through Liverpool at the time you were there; for 2 new species of Bryum had to be inserted in the Bryologia, &amp; the Printer would not wait—The least delay would have produced inconvenience: indeed I had scarcely time to get everything ready for the work –which was then on the eve of publication-- I shall be glad to know that it gives you satisfaction after due scrutiny, and cannot but wish it were better deserving of the favourable opinion which you kindly express—</p>
                  <p>The mode of remittance which is most convenient to yourself will be quite satisfactory to me: a cheque or order of any kind can be cashed by the Manch &amp; Livl District Bank here—</p>
                  <p>Pray excuse brevity; for I am still greatly pressed for time, &amp; believe me</p>
                  <p>Most truly &amp; respectfully yours | W. Wilson</p>
