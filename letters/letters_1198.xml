                        <p>The Cambridge P. Soc. have resolved upon forming a collection of British Shells &amp; Insects which I have offered to arrange for them. If you have any duplicates to spare pray send them, however common the species; they are certain of being acceptable to so infant a [page ripped]. I was in hopes of seeing you down here during the Machaon season, but the weather has been so very bad that I have had but one good day among them on which I caught 38 many are however very much tattered owing to the wind blowing them among the sedges. I am just leaving Cambridge but shall return on the 24 of this month &amp; intend residing all the summer when I shall be happy to hear from you.</p>
                        <p>Believe me</p>
                        <p>Yrs ever sincerely</p>

                        <p>P.S. It is odd enough we should both think of writing on the same day, for I reopen my letter to say I received yours this morning &amp; thank you for the communication, it will make me more anxious to procure conocephali in Oct. from the old locality. I thought Bulwer was going to Tenby for the summer &amp; not to Dublin</p>
