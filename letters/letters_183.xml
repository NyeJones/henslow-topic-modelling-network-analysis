                  <p>The day before I received your melancholy communication of the death of our friend Ramsay I had a letter from Calvert to the same effect. No event could have come me more unexpectedly. I had not even heard of his illness, except a slight indisposition which I imagined to be of no importance. For some time I have foreseen that Ramsay would not be long-lived, but I did hope to have had a longer enjoyment of his friendship, which I account one of the happiest circumstances of my life to have formed, before he went to receive his reward. The loss of Ramsay will be deeply felt not only by his friends, but by Cambridge in general. His death is a circumstance from which we ought to profit.</p>
                  <p>You are the most proper person to have the arrangements of his affairs at Cambridge, but I fear that you will have much difficulty in the task. His only account book was his banking book – but his banking book contained all his memorabilia with regard to money matters, so that you much look to it chiefly for information. His tutors acc. <hi rend="superscript">ts</hi> were kept with more regularity, but I fear that even these are far from being strictly regular. I don’t know that I possess any particular information respecting his affairs that you cannot come at from other sources, but perhaps if I were at Cambridge I might be able to give you a few hints, when you have discovered your desiderata if you think that I could be at all useful. I will take the opportunity of coming down for a day or two as soon after my return as you <del>might</del> may suggest.</p>
                  <p>What do you suppose to do with his <del>horse</del> mare and books and furniture? The <del>horse</del> mare was bought of Gorton three years ago, and he desires me to say that if she is to be sold he should like to have the offer of her, both because she suited him, and her having belonged to Ramsay gives her add. <hi rend="superscript">l</hi> interest. Perhaps his book case might suit me, and I should like to purchase some of his books.</p>
                  <p>I shall be here till next Friday at all events, perhaps longer, but if you send me a letter off not later than Tuesday I shall in any case receive it. Give me some outline of what you think of doing, and if you think I can be of any service to you, pray command me.– With kindest regards to M. <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Henslow</p>
                  <p>Believe me dear Henslow | very sincerely yours | Charles Green</p>
                  <p>I have not heard whether M. <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Henslow has yet increased her family. If you do not write so soon as Tuesday direct to me at the Rectory Burgh Castle, near Great Yarmouth.</p>
