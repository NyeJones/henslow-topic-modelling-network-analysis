                  <p>I cannot tell with how much pleasure I learn from the papers received here this morning that Ld. Palmerston secured his re-election. Upon principle, as well as from a desire to support your candidate, I have felt a warm interest in the result of this contest and it has been a matter of very serious regret to me that I have been prevented from giving my vote. Nothing but the calls of business which would admit of no denial should have detained me here; and I assure you that so late as last Tuesday night I made a great effort to release myself from my engagements here so that I might have been illeg the Senate House on Thursday morning; however I did not succeed in the attempt, so I now only mention the circumstances for the purpose of explaining to you the reason of my not having taken an earlier opportunity of thanking you for your kind offer to secure me a bed, and of explaining to you the situation in which I found myself placed. Had the cause been lost by a few votes I should have been so sorely vexed at my own absence; but fortunately I have now only to congratulate you upon the result, which must of course be very satisfactory to you &amp; is in my opinion very creditable to the University.</p>
                  <p>Believe me, Dear Henslow</p>
                  <p>Yours very truly</p>
