                        <p>Having projected a New Edition of "Miller's Gardeners Dictionary" as announced in the accompanying prospectus; I am desirous improving it, of having the assistance of those writers most current for their knowledge in the various subjects which my plan embraces. With this view I take the liberty of addressing you; and beg to know if your engagements will prevent you to favour me with an article upon your experiments in "Crossing" or any other includes in our plan which may have attracted your attention.</p>
                        <p>I may add for your information that the work will be got up and printed in a very superior style, and with illustrations of first rate character, Among the Gentlemen who have already promised their assistance Mr George Sinclair will write the articles upon planting trees &amp; the grasses; Mr Hayward some portion of the [missing text] Professor Renner will furnish the Botanical part and act as general Editor of the whole, &amp; Mr Main of Chelsea the Kitchen &amp; Fruit gardening I am also in communication with many other writers of great practical knowledge and I entertain no doubt of being able through these means to produce the most complete Body of practical information of these very interesting subjects which have yet appeared.</p>
                        <p>I do not presume to influence you by the offer of remuneration for any articles you may furnish but the "labourer is worthy of his hire" under all circumstances and you may name your own terms.</p>
