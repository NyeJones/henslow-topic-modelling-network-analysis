                  <p>The election of Examiners will take place on Wednesday, April 6 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi>; and I shall be very glad if you can arrange to be present. There will be an English and a French Examiner to be appointed to vacancies; and the Senate will very probably appoint a new man to the Examinership of Chemistry (now to include Experimental Philosophy also) and possibly also to one of the Mathematical Examinerships. There is also an Examinership in Surgery to be filled up.</p>
                  <p>The change which the Senate have made in my position will be very satisfactory to me in regard to comfort and freedom from responsibility. It will be rather the reverse of advantageous in point of income, and I shall have to give up what is worth more to me than the £300 a year added by the University. But the V.C. and several members of the Senate have expressed their readiness to promote a fees ther<del>e</del> increase to the £1000 a year originally talked of, when I shall have served a few years longer.</p>
                  <p>A friend of mine from India has brought home an Elephant’s skull, which he would gladly give to any Museum where such a thing is a desideratum. Would you like it.</p>
                  <p>yours most faithfully | Will <hi rend="superscript">m</hi> B. Carpenter</p>
