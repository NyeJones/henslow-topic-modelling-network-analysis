                  <p>I have brought sundry letters here, that I may answer when I really had no time for before leaving home. I am here for a couple of days to deliver a lecture on the "Diluvial Celts" or rather "Drift Celts" which have created so much surprise amongst Geologists &amp; Archaeologists. You ask about any work that can give you a popular view of the question. I am not aware of any such. The best exposition of the <hi rend="underline">facts</hi>, with duly cautious indications of the possible conclusions to which they seem to lead, is a paper by Mr Evans in the transactions of the Archaeological Society. He has sent me a copy which I can lend you, if you care to read it. The greater part is <hi rend="underline">un</hi>scientifically intelligible but you would find some portions of which you cannot appreciate precisely the bearing. I believe it is not yet published &amp; if it were, it would be in a fat volume of Transactions. The <hi rend="underline">facts</hi> are beyond dispute that the works of man have been <hi rend="underline">plentifully</hi> extracted from geological strata formed prior to the last catastrophe which gave the present configuration to the surface of the earth, in all the northern part of Europe. They must be of vast antiquity, but whether the works of a race <hi rend="underline">prior</hi> to the received account of our being placed on the earth is a very different question from whether it will be necessary to extend the received chronology of our race. As yet I am by no means satisfied that it will be <hi rend="underline">proved</hi> necessary to extend our chronology - but the facts are extraordinary, &amp; very unexpected. Additional facts of the same class are daily turning up &amp; these Drift Celts have now been found in at least 3 districts in Suffolk - in others in the valley of the Thames - &amp; within a few days, at Herne Bay. I have myself no doubt that further reesearches will furnish materials for distinct inductions, &amp; that geologists will soon be in a position to decide with certainty two or three points of deep intent.</p>
                  <p>1. Whether man was coeval with the large extinct Animals hereto supposed to have been removed from the Earth before our race was placed upon it.</p>
                  <p>2. Whether the extinction of these animals took place within a far shorter period than has been supposed.</p>
                  <p>3. The decision of these 2 points will tend to show whether our chronologies (as hitherto received are trustworthy or not.</p>
                  <p>Darwin's speculations are far less likely to be <hi rend="underline">proved</hi> (if provable (? which I do <hi rend="underline">not</hi> consider <hi rend="underline">likely</hi>) than these Drift Celt questions. I think he &amp; some others assume far more than the <hi rend="underline">facts</hi> warrant.</p>
                  <p>For my own part I regard the discovery of <hi rend="underline">truth</hi> essential to the correct appreciation of the Creator's intentions in regard to the Revelation he has given us by his Inspired Prophets &amp; Apostles. I am no disciple of the Reviews &amp; Essays School - being firmly convinced of the doctrines of my own Church - &amp; understanding them to have been deduced from the Spirit &amp; not the mere letter of the Scriptures. There may be difficulties in the way of unity - Natural &amp; Revealed Religion - but they will ultimately vanish, as truth dispels the myths.</p>
                  <p>Yrs very affy</p>
