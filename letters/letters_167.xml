                  <p>Your list of Desiderata, like my own, begins to comprise nothing but rarities and doubtful natives. However during the course of the summer I hope to pick up a few specimens for you, two or three of the Roses mentioned grow in this neighbourhood &amp; some other plants within reach. Lindleys Rubi form a part of your catalogue – if you have Rubus fruticosus, corylifolius &amp; glandulosus you want but few of the Blackberries, except the Highland species R. suberectus &amp; probably the R. leucostachys, neither of which are indigenous here.– Though I do not grudge the carriage of packets from good botanists yet cash may be as well saved.– &amp; as my old friend Huntley of Kimbolton is in constant communication with his relations here, he could transmit me, without inconvenience, anything you may be so kind as send. Probably I have mentioned that exotics, even garden specimens if rare are extremely acceptable – my Herbarium of foreign plants far exceeding in number my british one. If you should see our friend Sedgwick I think he would add a copy of his last address to the Geol: Soc <hi rend="superscript">y</hi> to your parcel, and pray ask him where Sharks teeth have been found in the carboniferous Limestone of Northumb. <hi rend="superscript">d</hi>? I cannot help suspecting some mistake, as was the case with the head of a Saurian animal sent to the York museum by Vernon.– That was found in the diluvium. The Natural History Society here are printing my Catalogue Raisonné of the North. <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> &amp; Durham Flora, it is an extensive one being the result of more than thirty years attention to the subject, when finished, a copy shall be sent you.– In it the three common Primula are made var. <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> (alpha, beta &amp; gamma symbols) – according to your suggestion, &amp; Anagallis arvensis &amp; coerulea.– alpha &amp; beta – On many species of Rosa &amp; Salix I have had no mercy. They have been long under my notice.– I suspect Juncus nigrisellus grows with us– but the sp. <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> sent me are not good enough to settle to my satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Believe me to be | my dear Sir | yours very sincerely |Nat. J <hi rend="superscript">s </hi>. Winch</p>
