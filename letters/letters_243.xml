                  <p>I have been to Burgh Castle all the morning, &amp; had intended calling upon you to take leave, after dinner–but I was informed that two friends had been here, &amp; stated their intention of looking in this evening, so that I could not get out– Allow me to thank you very sincerely for the kindness &amp; hospitality we have received &amp; to say how much pleasure we should receive at finding any of your family under our roof at Hitcham– You were quite at liberty to have kept the <hi rend="underline">whole</hi> of the letters left for your inspection, &amp; I am only too happy to think that you have found some of them worthy a place among your collection’s– I shall take care to put bye any I may receive from persons of whom I may fancy you would like autograph letters, &amp; shall take opportunities of letting you see them &amp; selecting from them– Many thanks also for your kind invitation– &amp; should it please God that we have opportunity of again meeting, I can assure you it will afford myself the greatest pleasure– With our united regards to Mrs &amp; Miss Turner</p>
                  <p>Believe me | very sincerely yours | J S Henslow</p>
