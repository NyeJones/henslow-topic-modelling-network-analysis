                        <p>The Vice Chancellor Dr Webb informed me today that he had received notice that the sums voted by Parliament for the salaries of the Professors would be paid to him at the Treasury. He drew a cheque for the money at his Banker's, which has been refused on the plea that it is necessary that he should first certify that he <hi rend="doubleUnderline">is</hi> the Vice Chancellor. He tells me that he is puzzled how to proceed, &amp; I have engaged to ask you. It seems to him that a reference to an Almanack might satisfy the scruples of the gentleman who has refused his draft but if this cannot be, he wishes to know how he is to proceed. Will you be kind enough to excuse my troubling you on the subject, but I thought it best to apply at once to Head Quarters.</p>
                        <p>I believe I have to thank you for sending me a pamphlet which I have read with great pleasure &amp; profit &amp; hope it will receive the full attention which it deserves in the Country.</p>
                        <p>Believe me</p>
                        <p>very truly</p>
