                  <p>I received a packet of Sea weeds from you a long time ago: I have not however yet had time to Examine them, being busily engaged with y <hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Madeira Cryptogamic vegetables for Lowe: as soon however as I can I will return them. I see there are some admirable things amongst them particularly <hi rend="underline">Fucus Gigantinus</hi>. The Branch with y <hi rend="superscript">e </hi>roots to it belonged to <hi rend="underline">Prunus lauro-cerasus.</hi> I got a bough of <hi rend="underline">Tilia parvifolia</hi> for you which shall go to you whenever I can get it franked. Lowe was with me for a few days, which we enjoyed greatly. He is now I believe in London with my Mother: I shall feel highly obliged to you, if you will send y <hi rend="superscript">e</hi> books which accompany this to y <hi rend="superscript">e</hi> public Library for me, as I am not able to go myself now. I hope to be in Cambridge y <hi rend="superscript">e</hi> last week in October for a single day on my way from Margate, where I intend to spend a fortnight.</p>
                  <p>In y <hi rend="superscript">e</hi> second week in November I go down to my new Curacy near Wisbeach, which, tho not actually in Cambridgeshire lies on y <hi rend="superscript">e</hi> very confines of it, y <hi rend="superscript">e</hi> adjoining parish being in that County, so that I hope to do you some service in y <hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Cambridge Flora, and perhaps some for Leonard Jenyns in y <hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Fauna.— I shall at any rate be able to secure you all y <hi rend="superscript">e</hi> marine productions, which it is impossible to get in a casual visit, and I hope we shall be able to make some excursions together at no great distance of time.</p>
                  <p>I have got three difft bats for Leonard Jenyns, but I have no means of sending them at present.</p>
                  <p>I enclose a few plants such as I can lay my hands upon. Amongst them <hi rend="underline">Chenopodium hybridum</hi>; and a species of Potentilla unlike any British one of that genus or Tormentilla. Compare specimens and you will see how diff <hi rend="superscript">t</hi> y <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> leaves are. It is perhaps most like <hi rend="underline">Potentilla opaca</hi>. M <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henderson has found but one patch of it in a wood near Milton.</p>
                  <p>I hope M <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Henslow is quite well, remember me to her and believe me very truly yours | M J Berkeley</p>
                  <p>Biggs promised me seeds of Anotheca longiflora, d <hi rend="superscript">o </hi>nocturna</p>
                  <p>be so good as to put him in mind of it</p>
