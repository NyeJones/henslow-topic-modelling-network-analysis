                        <p>I have just unpacked the two boxes of fossils which arrived on Saturday last, &amp; find them full of capital things. I shall be compelled to lay them on the shelf till my lectures are over - for on Thursday I go to Cambridge to lecture every day for a month. But on my return I will set to work immediately, &amp; if you think it possible, should certainly strive to see the 1st No. out before the meeting of the Association. You have taken for granted a great deal too much of my knowledge of paper making which is of the most general description. The specimens sent are exactly what I wish to have, but if you could possibly procure me the manufactured articles, &amp; any old implements - &amp; account to correspond with the specimens I sd. feel very grateful. I will place an x against such Nos. as I have received, &amp; you will see what are wanting to complete the series &amp; if a little memorandum were furnished for describing what each is, &amp; the manufactured specimen to accompany each I see that by help of Wasp-nests (the oldest paper manufactory) &amp; a few other items I can give them a good lecture. I mean one that will engage their attention.</p>

                        <p>The person (a farmer &amp; coal merchant) who fetched the boxes from Ipswich was considerably horrified at what he considered a great imposition in the price of carriage. To me it seemed reasonably enough &amp; I should not have complained - but he wished me to say that he inquired of his friends &amp; of a Captain of another Hag &amp; they told him that the charge ought to have been 4/- instead  of 10/- for the 2 boxes. He bids me say that if you send any box directed in future to Messrs. Byles, I shall receive them without such expense. I beg to assure you that I am too happy to get them as you may see fit to send them, &amp; should not have thought of mentioning the subject, if my Farmer here had not expressed his wishes that I wd. do so. He was told that C. Page to whom they were consigned always made it a rule to <hi rend="underline">lay it on</hi> as he expressed himself whenever he had a box for a gentleman. Pray don't think twice about this - but I have discharged my errand.</p>
