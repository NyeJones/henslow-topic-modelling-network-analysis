                        <p>Not to keep you in suspense I shall at once answer your letter tho' I fear I cannot yet completely answer any of your queries.</p>
                        <p>1. Whewell gave copies of the report to Quetelet &amp; Dufresnay [?], but thinks that Rogers need not have one. I will send one to Agardh. </p>
                        <p>2. The Reporter has not yet completed his task, but will finish tonight &amp; then we shall revise it &amp; get it printed in 4to to correspond with the Lithographs. Perhaps the University will do this for us free of expense.</p>
                        <p>It will therefore be hardly necessy. to prepare a 2d transcript for you.</p>
                        <p>3. &amp; 4. I have only received Daubeny's papers &amp; will send them to you with any others that I may yet receive in a few days.</p>
                        <p>5. When I have done with the list of members I will send you the book, &amp; I will draw up a sketch of what <hi rend="underline">ought to be</hi> the routine on another occasion for admitting them &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>6. The lithographic names is an awful consideration. I find it will be an expense of about 200£. To cover this we must sell 1000 copies at 4/. each, which I think may be effected by sending a letter to the members stating that each Member (&amp; Members <hi rend="underline">only</hi>) may provide themselves with one or two copies. 3000 were too many, but it can't be helped now, &amp; if there are not sufft. sold off before next meeting I think that some will at the next &amp; that <hi rend="underline">ultimately</hi> we shall not be losers. I have received a few more compositions from men who approve of our plan of laying out their money in encouraging experimental researches &amp; I doubt not that we shall receive still more. Our aquatic expedition was of the most successful kind - we started at 10 &amp; returned at 11 P.M. apparently quite satisfied. We held a section in the Barge which discussed the subject of <hi rend="underline">colors</hi> to be adopted in descriptions of Nat. History. We had Smith, Brunel, Greenough, Sir C. Lemon, Selby, Curtis, Stephens, Agardh, cum multis aliis - in all between 40 &amp; 50.</p>
                        <p>Believe me</p>
                        <p>very sincerely yrs</p>
