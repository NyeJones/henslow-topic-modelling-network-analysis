                        <p>Many thanks for the report which I have read with equal interest &amp; pleasure as exhibiting such gratifying proofs of the success of your unwearied exertions to elevate the character &amp; increase the happiness of your parishioners by rewarding habits of industry order &amp; observation. </p>
