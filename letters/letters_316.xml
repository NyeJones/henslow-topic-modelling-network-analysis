                  <p>I was in London <del>,</del> last week, but unfortunately caught cold going up, and was unable to leave the house almost the whole time of my being there. – I could not in con <hi rend="superscript">sc</hi> go to Baillieu’s myself, but I got Yarrell to call, – &amp; to give him the commission about Achille Comte’s tableaux du Reg. An. – which he said he would attend to.</p>
                  <p>He said he had not sent any to you for some time back because you ordered him not on the occasion of your leaving Cambridge.</p>
                  <p>It is of no importance your not having yet attended to the Botanical notes on White’s Selbourne as I am only now just beginning to set to work again upon the subject myself, – but I hope you will not forget it altogether; – and it will be quite time enough if I have them by the beginning, or even the middle, of next month. –</p>
                  <p>Also I wish you would send me (this as soon as you are able) – the roughest pencil sketch, such as need not take you more than a few minutes, – of the Harvest-Mouse, in the attitude in w. <hi rend="superscript">h</hi> you so often see your own, – of running down the twig, &amp; stopping in its descent with the extremity of its tail curled round the stem; – I hope too, that when you give me your botanical notes, you will include one on the H. mouse, – detailing anything you have observed in its habits w. <hi rend="superscript">h</hi> you think interesting &amp; adapt it for insertion. –</p>
                  <p>Charles &amp; I came down together yesterday: He talks of going to you when he leaves Bottisham, &amp; he has written a line or two above the last page in relation thereto.[ I shall expect to hear whether it suits you to receive me 29 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or at present advised Chas.]</p>
                  <p>It is a long time since I heard from Harriet, – but hope she &amp; all the rest are well. – Give her my love, &amp; Believe I am,</p>
                  <p>Yours aff’ly | L. Jenyns</p>
