                  <p>That I am a most careless &amp; irregular correspondent is most certain - and I have no doubt there are many omissions that I am charged with towards you; for these however I must beg you forgiveness. A pause gives me the opportunity of thanking you on the part of myself &amp; Bentham for the China plants - and of conveying that I will on Monday endeavour to find you a few that may interest you and despatch them [text illegible].</p>
                  <p>I really wish you would look at my theory, for I cannot but think that however much chaff you may winnow out of it, a few pieces of corn will repay you for yr trouble. That some entire change in the present method of treating the mature relations of plants has known near impossible, especially to those who have to teach the science must I think be admitted; &amp; the question is how that change can be but effected. If I might be allowed to express an opinion of my own persuasion I should that say that the Endogenae are the best order &amp; that the [text illegible] parts of all are the Epigynous &amp; Parietal Cohorts. To the Albuminous Polypetalous Cohort I am much attached.</p>
                  <p>[Text illegible] <hi rend="underline">Nexus</hi>; and yet I did not originate the application of the word in the sense I have used it. You will find it in Fries's writings employed to express the word "tendency" which is I know its classical application; &amp; I meant the title to express the "tendencies of plants" not the "connections of plants". I wish you would tell me whether after this explanation you still think the name a <hi rend="underline">bad</hi> one; for a Cambridge authority must be paramount in such matters. I should in that case certainly alter the title to Nexus in another edition.</p>
                  <p>I am working upon the 4th part of my Gen &amp; Sp. book &amp; have now to deal with the European Ophrydae, in which I find much to improve &amp; reject. [text illegible] of species &amp; identification of synonyms I feel disposed to consider the British Orchis [text illegible] distinct from that of the continent. Although specimens of the former that I have seen agree in having a labellum quite of the hairy line that passes down the axis in all the foreign O. tiph; its tissue is also most remarkably lax, &amp; its surface is covered all over with little crystalline warts. [text illegible] spike is particularly thin &amp; starved. I wish if you have any material, you would give me yr opinion upon this point.</p>
                  <p>Could you oblige me with a specimen of Mr Laws Orchis plena &amp; Goodyera macrophylla of the former. I have seen no <hi rend="underline">certain</hi> specimen and of the latter I know nothing except after the the Figure. I am so anxious to have no [text illegible] that will ensure my accuracy in this troublesome Monograph, that I trust you will pardon the liberty I take in consulting you about such points, &amp; in asking for specimens.</p>
                  <p>Pray believe me My Dear Sir</p>
                  <p>Ever Yrs truly</p>
                  <p>John Lindley</p>
                  <p>The accompanying letter came to me the other day from De Candolle. I presume you have Mr Laws address. I append.</p>
