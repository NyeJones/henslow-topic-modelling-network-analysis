                  <p>You are welcome to as many of my notices as you can find any use for – I sent one to an excellent liberal Landlord at this Parish who is ( I believe) near Reigate at present – I mean Sir B. Brodie – I have had the idea passing thro’ my head of a <hi rend="underline">select</hi> party – for 2 or 3 days in London, but this would be a somewhat expensive affair &amp; could only be managed for a few – I once sent one of our more intelligent labourers to see London under his Brother’s auspices, &amp; it did him much good. There are plenty of <hi rend="underline">free</hi> sights, &amp; I think I have interest enough with <hi rend="underline">some</hi> others to obtain free admission for country cousins – which would reduce our expences to travelling, bed &amp; board; &amp; with due economy I fancy (D.V.) another year may produce something of the sort you describe – a little mismanagement of <hi rend="underline">their</hi> funds by our Ipswich friends squandered <hi rend="underline">in our cause</hi> as least 10£ to 15£ which found its way into the pockets of those who are always ready to plunder – but this was no affair of mine – &amp; where I have the arrangement in my own hands I should effectually prevent anything of the sort – but <hi rend="underline">Feoffes</hi> are really <hi rend="underline">Trustees</hi> of certain lands left to the poor – we receive about 80£ in rent from these, which is not well distributed – but I have contrived to improve upon old practices – when I came here it was entirely given away in silver – with a good deal of favoritism – The Vestry door was guarded by constables – one claimant introduced at a time – &amp; no body satisfied – &amp; the Feoffes generally were more or less abused at the end– By drawing up a precise scale for the distribution, &amp; appropriating 30£ towards Coals, we now meet all together in the School room – &amp; scarcely a grumble is ever heard – If so the case is publickly discussed &amp; decided before the whole party – Mr <hi rend="underline">Wood</hi>, the Sec.y of the Lab. Friends Soc.y &lt;has&gt; is the person to whom I refer, you name a Mr Martin who will assist – &amp; certainly I shall be thankful for the experience of any one who is disposed to do so – I am sorry I can’t get to Birmingham – but it is rather to far for the length of my Tether–</p>
                  <p>very truly yours</p>
                  <p>J. S. Henslow</p>
