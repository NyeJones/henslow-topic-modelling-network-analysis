                  <p>I thank you for your very interesting notice of the opening of the barrow. When you have a little leisure I hope you will not forget the Archaeological Association, and permit us to have a paper read at Canterbury on the subject and a sketch exhibited. I am very anxious that we should do something there worthy of ourselves and our cause and therefore any brief papers you may be pleased to give would be esteemed by me as a personal favour. The leaden coffin as you surmise is rare and interesting. I discovered one last year in Goodman’s Fields, London, which was subsequently destroyed. The lid lapped over like yours and there was a beading [small sketch] at the bottom. One was found by my friend Mons <hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> De Gerville FSA. at Coutances or near. In it was a glass bottle and a coin of Postumius. [sketch of bottle].</p>
                  <p>I do not think anything exactly resembling the vault has been found in England. The arrangement of the tiles &amp;c will be very useful when drawn. Have any of the tiles inscriptions? I found one the other day in London. BR.LON</p>
                  <p>I have been to examine the Roman pottery at Dymchurch. They have found fragments of a hundred varieties or more. The discovery is useful in a topographical point of view as shewing, contrary I think to general theory, that in the time of the Romans, this part of Romney marsh was not covered by the sea. The immense quantity of fossils in the stones on the beach would make a visit pleasing to you, &amp; I am sure the Rev M <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Issacson would show you every attention, as he did to me.</p>
                  <p>On the summit of the high hill near Folkestone, I excavated part of an urn (with my knife!) The beautiful Roman Pharos <del>h</del> at Dover has recently been walled up so that the interior is now inaccessible. The old Duke is evidently in his dotage or he would not have ordered such an outrage upon good taste and decency. He must be taught better. How absurd it is that our monuments are in the custody of such persons!– Bred up to fight and kill (moral scavengers of society) what do they know or care about the arts and sciences that humanise &amp; instruct?</p>
                  <p>Believe me, my dear Sir, | very respectfully yours, |C Roach Smith</p>
