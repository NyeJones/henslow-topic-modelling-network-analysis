                  <p>I trouble you with half a dozen lines to express my wishes for your success – Had I a vote it should be at your service but though my name is on the board, I have never kept the prescribed number of terms to entitle me to that privilege. Though I formerly felt anxious to succeed the late venerable Professor of Botany, I am now too advanced in life, &amp; my eyes &amp; memory fail me too much to render it desirable for me to become your opponent.</p>
                  <p>If you are unfurnished with a Willdenow’s <hi rend="underline">Species Plantarum</hi> I have a copy which I could let you have at a smaller price I think than they ask for them in England – likewise <hi rend="underline">Hedwigs Muscologia </hi>&amp; <hi rend="underline">Species Muscorum </hi>is 4 <hi rend="underline">octavo </hi>4 quarto- there are 10 of Willdenow. A friend procured them for me on the continent, &amp; each cost me £5.00, at which price they are at your service.</p>
                  <p>I purchased at the Brookes sale at Elmstead his <hi rend="underline">Hortus Siccus, </hi>both British and Exotic – they cost me £30, &amp; I have added to the number of specimens. If you want anything of this kind, I have no objection to part with them.</p>
                  <p>If I can be of any service to you in your present object it will give me great pleasure.</p>
                  <p>I am | Dear sir | y <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> very faithfully | W <hi rend="superscript">m</hi> Kirby</p>
                  <p>June 25. P.S. Since writing the above I have received information that Government has appointed you to the Professorship. If this is correct I sincerely congratulate you. I was not aware before there was any expectation that Government would interfere in the appointment. Will you have the goodness to send the Note to Mr Francis.</p>
