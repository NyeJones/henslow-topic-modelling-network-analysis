                  <p>I take the liberty of directing your attention to the accompanying Remarks, because I am desirous of obtaining your sanction to them. I have lately decided upon relinquishing the practice of my Profession, and upon devoting myself altogether to the pursuit of Physiology and its allied Sciences. This determination involves a very serious pecuniary sacrifice; and I cannot but feel very keenly, therefore, an attack which will have so prejudicial an influence on my future prospects, if I do not take some very decided mode of silencing the calumny– I am desirous of procuring, for this purpose, the testimony of men whose position may give weight to their statements; and, on a subject of this scientifico-theological character, no testimony will be so valuable as that of orthodox–still better, clerical– men of science. I have taken the liberty of writing to Prof. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark on the subject; and I shall feel obliged by your letting him see the copy of my Principles of Physiology which I sent to you, if he have not one in his own possession.</p>
                  <p>What I take the liberty of requesting from yourself (as early as convenient) is an opinion of the correctness and tendency of the views expressed in the Chapter “on the Nature &amp; Causes of Vital Actions”, and in the concluding one, on the “Evidences of Design”. I believe that you will (generally, at least) agree with me in regard to the correctness of my views. I feel sure that you will exonerate me from the imputations laid to my charge in regard to their dangerous tendency – I do not apologise for thus troubling you, since I feel confident that you will rejoice in doing an act of justice of this kind, in behalf of one who is making the Science of Physiology his pursuit.</p>
                  <p>If, at the same time, you could give me a separate testimonial as to the general merits of my Volume, especially the mode in which the vegetable Physiology is brought to bear upon the Animal, it might hereafter be very useful to me.</p>
                  <p>Believe me to remain |Dear Sir |respect <hi rend="superscript">ly</hi> &amp; sinc <hi rend="superscript">ly</hi> yours | William B. Carpenter</p>
