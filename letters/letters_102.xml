                  <p>Having long since received through M <hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Baxter of the Physic Garden Oxford a very kind offer from you to supply me with specimens of Mespilus Cotoneaster which offer I appear to have treated with neglect, I looked today through my very poor set of duplicates for a few reasons for acknowledging the kindness, in a form which allows me to introduce myself to you without ceremony. There is little <del>here</del> in this packet excepting Cyperus longus, worthy your notice: the seeds are few indeed: but I have had no leisure to pursue botany during the past season― in the previous one I was still an Invalid― and being besides remiss in drying specimens, my stores are inconsiderable, &amp; have been already much decreased. Yet I may hope to do more, &amp; have the promise of opportunity: &amp; requesting you to consider this, Fasciculus primus, and not, as the form generally runs "a specimen of the work," I beg of you to acquaint me fully of your desiderata, in species to be collected in this country, and to believe me willing to do my best in your service.</p>
                  <p>Should you ever be able to spare a duplicate of any Cambridge plants, of which I have no one individual, may I name Stratiotis aloides, Papaver Cambricum, Malaxis paludosa? I name the last because you have the happiness to be its new-discoverer, but not with any hope to become possessed of a specimen of so rare &amp; local a plant. I am devotedly fond of Orchideæ, &amp; have specimens of all but the very rarest.― Thus I turn an acknowledgment into a petition, &amp; blush in doing so.</p>
                  <p>Had I not heard of your kindness to all who love science I should have hesitated longer. But now I am emboldened by your own challenge to commence a welcome duty, and be valued by, my dear Sir, | yours respectfully &amp; gratefully | Gerard E Smith</p>
