                        <p>Upton has just brought me your letter &amp; the Conferva. The latter is rather damaged but I will examine it &amp; see if I can make anything of it. I now merely write to say that I shall be most happy to coincide in any views which the Society organised at York may have adopted. I have given my name to Whewell as one of a Cambridge Committee &amp; shall most certainly (if all be well &amp; possible) be at Oxford. I regret exceedingly that I cd. not get to York but it was impossible for me to go there under the circumstances I was placed in with any comfort - expecting daily as I still am to hear of the departure of my Brother to a better world. I have been to see him at intervals lately &amp; have not the slightest hope of his recovery. If it had not been for this circumstance I should have enjoyed the meeting beyond any thing. Mrs Buckland informed me a short time back that you were experimenting upon plants in her garden. I suppose you know Saussure's work. He seems to me to account very satisfactorily for the introduction of various matters into the substance of plants. You must get up a Botanical <hi rend="underline">excursion</hi> for us in the neighbourhood of Oxford, when we come - Captn. Daubeny &amp; Lieutt. Baxter commanding the squad. Only don't sow any rare seeds this autumn to deceive us into the belief that your flora is richer than it is.</p>
                        <p>Believe me</p>
                        <p>Very sincerely yrs</p>
