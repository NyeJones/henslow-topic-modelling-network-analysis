                  <p>I am much obliged by the inspection of the Norway Grous's Herbarium - which has amused myself &amp; others to whom I have shown it. Some of the specimens were gone before it came into my possession. I know Price very well, &amp; often correspond with him. As my friend Darwin (who also knows Price) is much interested by accounts of the various manners in which the seeds of plants are dispersed, when I next write to him, I will tell him of Price's method of ascertaining how much &amp; what Grous can carry off in his prop. I once received some black barley which had been raised from grains taken from the crop of a Canada goose shot as it was flying from far north across the northern part of Canada.</p>
                  <p>My kind regards to your sister &amp; brothers when you see them &amp; believe me</p>
                  <p>very sincerely Yrs</p>
