                    <p>When at Ipswich last Monday I was shown numerous fragments of Deluvial bones - mostly very decayed &amp; worthless - from the cutting near that town. The best had been disposed of to a Mr Acton of someplace near Ipswich, &amp; he was in treaty for most of the remainder. I was told he had given 5 guineas for a large bone more that 5 feet in circumference. I picked out 3 <hi rend="underline">very small</hi> Elephants (?) teeth, which appeared to me curious - some fragments of Megatherium (?) footbones (?) a horse's hoof &amp; the bone to which it disarticulated &amp; one or two other things for which I gave 15/- If you think them worth the money you may have them for the Woodwardian as indeed I had your collection in my eye - but if they are worthless to you they may adorn my attic. I also procured specimens for you of the artificial sandstone. As I come to your dinner I can bring these things with me, if you care to have them - but they need not take an airing to &amp; from Cambridge if you do not. I find it will advantage Charlesworth to take in his journal through a friend at Ipswich, &amp; if you care to give him a lift, in spite of his snarls at Owen perhaps you will authorise me to procure your copies in the same way, &amp; you can receive them via Phil. Soc. as they appear. The subscription is 21/- annually. Girls away at the Bury Ball </p>
