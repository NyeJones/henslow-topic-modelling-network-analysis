                  <p>I have this evening rec. <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> the Prospectus of your Diagrams which I have read with much interest. I hear from Don &amp; Son that they are very beautiful; and Lyon Playfair who I met in Dublin on the first ins <hi rend="superscript">t</hi>., told me the same. I do sincerely hope that the sale of them may be extensive, and that they may serve not as decorations for the school-room, but as the means of leading every pupil to a practical knowledge of all that they are intended to teach.</p>
                  <p>The great difficulty I have found is with the teachers. They have to become learners, before they can attempt to teach. Some are indolent—some not disposed to turn to branches of knowledge which they have not been taught to care for—and some teach “by the book”, and seek not to ascertain if the pupil really understands what is there set down. So far as the schools here are concerned I am thinking of offering some kind of premium, whether for the teachers or the pupils I am not sure— but I am disposed to think it must be something that would make the teacher be regarded favourably by the District Inspector, and immediately or remotely tend to give him a higher status, and better his condition. I also have never ceased to urge on the Commissioners of National Education in Dublin the necessity of making Nat. Hist <hi rend="superscript">y</hi> a regular part of the course of Education in their Training Schools.</p>
                  <p>From the progress that has been made during the last ten years, I do not doubt that these difficulties will be overcome, and on every side pleasant little events are occurring to cheer us on, and make us persevere in our efforts.</p>
                  <p>It gives me great pleasure to think that I am associated in such labours with one whom I esteem so highly as yourself. Perhaps this circumstance may at times induce me “to bestow my tediousness upon you” even more largely than at present.</p>
                  <p>Believe me |my dear Sir |very sincerely yours |Robert Patterson</p>
