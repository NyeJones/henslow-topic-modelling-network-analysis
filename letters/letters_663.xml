                  <p>I read your school report with much interest. I have no doubt that you are quite right about the learning by rote. I am sensible of having derived a great advantage from the practice in my own case. When I was young I learned a great deal by rote <del>in w</del> I found what I have learned to be a great resource to me during the more active part of my professional life, when <del>I</del> in travelling I have to pass many a long night by myself in a hack-chaise. When I could not sleep I had always something to do &amp; think of, which made my solitary journeys agreeable rather than irksome. In your school-children, moreover the learning good things by rote, under your direction, will be very beneficial by keeping bad things out of their head.</p>
                  <p>I am not surprized that you have some bad folks among your allottees, for where are they not? We must take human nature as it is, &amp; not be disheartened if we are sometimes thwarted in our attempts to do good.</p>
                  <p>Lady Brodie desires to be kindly remembered to you.</p>
                  <p>Always Dear Sir | yours faithfully |B C Brodie</p>
