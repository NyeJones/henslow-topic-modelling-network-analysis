                  <p>I have just received your kind note, and beg to assure you that no apologies of any kind were necessary for the short delay that has occurred in preparing the little illustrations for the Royal Children, as it was fully understood that their preparation would require time, and that your absence from England, and subsequent continuous employment renders it out of the question to prepare them at present.—I am only surprised to hear that you have already advanced so far with them.—</p>
                  <p>If any apologies are needed they ought to proceed from me, as I am very shortly about to trouble you with the specimens of plants collected by H. R. H. Prince Arthur in Scotland.— They are now being mounted on paper, and when completed the young Prince is anxious for you to look over them, &amp; see whether he has got the correct names.—</p>
                  <p>I was so glad to hear of the success of your exhibition and only regretted not being able to be a witness of it at the time. Your description of the carpenter’s exclamation is most amusing and very characteristic. The thing is certain, that one could not honestly contradict his assertion.</p>
                  <p>Believe me, | yrs truly | H. Elphinstone</p>
