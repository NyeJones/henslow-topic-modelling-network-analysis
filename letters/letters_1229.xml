                        <p>I am much obliged for your letter which I have just received on my return to Cambridge again. The only subject on which I should wish to hear from you again is respecting the pecuniary arrangements. I have a great disinclination to any thing which involves <hi rend="underline">uncertainty</hi> &amp; have always declined engagements of the kind you mention. I had much rather be <hi rend="underline">secured</hi> in a much smaller sum than I should be likely to receive on your old plan than have anything to do with the publication of the work. If you will name the terms on which you would wish me to assist you - so much per sheet or so much per annum, I dare say we shall readily agree. I have no money to throw away in risking loss, &amp; I should wish to receive something like a remuneration for positive labour. If you will be kind enough to state at once what you may consider my services worth towards the continuing the F. F. I will, without any bargaining, say yes or no; and in the event of the former monosyllable being the answer will immediately set to work in making myself master of the subject to the best of my ability.</p>
                        <p>Yrs very truly</p>
                        <p>J. S. Henslow</p>
                        <p>P.S. I had thought that Lindley had been employed by you much in the way I here propose, or I should have been more explicit at first.</p>
