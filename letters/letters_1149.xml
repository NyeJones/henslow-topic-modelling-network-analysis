                        <p>In thanking you for your letter announcing your forthcoming collection, I beg to tell you that Battersea Fields have produced a wonder which ought to bring you to town by return of post.</p>
                        <p>A tree of some size, (Beech?) said to have been blasted by lightning, was cut down and sold to a wood merchant who lived at hand &amp; who was sawing up the trunk, met with a ferruginous mass in the middle (or apparently so). This metallic mass he uncovered to the length of 10 or 12 inches &amp; leaving the other end fast in the tree, very properly brought the whole section to us ie a transverse slice of the tree about 2 feet in diameter with the iron (having an elongated form) in the direction of the stem &amp; sticking part in it!</p>
                        <p>On analysis the iron has already afforded both Nickel &amp; [gap] the latter in greatest quantity. Part of the mass is crystaline magnetic iron - another part is strong &amp; like a meteorite.</p>
                        <p>I have no doubt that the whole is of meteoric origin &amp; that it was shot down into a cavity of this tree or between two branches of it.</p>
                        <p>It would appear from bark having grown around it on one side, that after the meteorite had been so lodged, the tree lived for a good many years, like a wounded soldier with a ball in him.</p>
                        <p>You who write so much botanical &amp; mineralogical knowledge should certainly see &amp; necessarily inspect this wonder.</p>
                        <p>Yours most sincerely</p>
                        <p>Rod. I. Murchison</p>
