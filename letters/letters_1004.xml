            <p>Makes arrangements for a visit to see potential archaeological sites in Derby area discussed by Belper in previous letter: potential Roman remains on the banks of the River Derwent opposite Little Chester; a barrow in Tugford that looks to be unopened. JSH states samian ware may be indicative of a Roman burial ground.</p>
            <p>JSH also discusses son's curacy at Hitcham, local responsibilities including horticultural shows and recent ill health.</p>

                    <p>First I must congratulate you on your new Title, which I has seen notices in the papers, though I did not feel absolutely certain whether it was yourself or some relative who might be intended. Though time has indeed passed or rather flown since my former visit, I have too lively a recollection of the pleasure I then experienced not to rejoice in the prospect of a renewal if I can continue it. I am fully engaged up to the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> - but I think I might continue either in the week beginning with Monday 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> or in that beginning with Monday 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> It so happens that after ten years during which I was never once absent from my parish I have had a little liberty - during the last 2 years from my eldest son having become my Curate. This enabled me last year to go to the Paris Exposition - &amp; I have this year been away for a Sunday at the Cheltenham meeting - My son however has just accepted a curacy at a distance, in the laudable desire of improving himself by going a little more alone than stopping at home enables him to do - I think he is right, though I am very sorry to lose him, as we have got on harmoniously together. It so happens that his last Sunday here will be the  21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> so that I am again tied to my Sundays &amp; must arrange accordingly - I hope to have a new Curate in November; for although I can manage the clubs &amp; parish singlehanded, it is rather more work as I get older than medical advisers consider proper. Two years ago a neuralgic attack was ascribed to overwork &amp; I was advised to take an iron or two out of the fire - live better, recreate more &amp; keep warm - all comfortable medicines, which properly attended to enable me to employ myself as actively as ever  - This time of year is always a busy season - I have promised this week to assist in rigging out a Marquee Museum for L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Henniker at his Horticultural Show - &amp; the week after I have to prepare for my own, which comes off on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. If then, you find it can be conveniently arranged for me to come to you during either of the weeks I have named - allowing time for getting back by Saturday - I shall be most happy to renew our acquaintance &amp; assist in the proposed operations - I suspect the Samian ware is indicative of a Roman Burial ground. There are two at Colchester which extend over several (I believe) acres. The vases have been deposited in trenches, much after the fashion of those in Kingston, &amp; possibly you have a rich harvest before you. When I hear again I may perhaps suggest a few tentative processes to be undertaken before I come. With best respect to Lady Belper</p> 
                  <p>believe me</p>
                  <p>very faithfully yours</p>
                  <p>J. S. Henslow</p>
