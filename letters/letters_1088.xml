                        <p>I am much obliged to you for the paper you sent me – It will afford me
                            some useful hints for extending my own plan of laying before the Parish
                            our Club acs/- which I have been in the habit of doing for some years
                            past every Easter – I forgot whether I ever sent you a copy before,
                            &amp; so enclose the last for 1846, as I have not yet made out the ac/-
                            for 1847 – I like the idea of publishing the Collections for Queen’s
                            letters &amp; Sacrament fund – and to my own I can add the receipts of
                            our Benefit Club, Medical Club, &amp; the money expended from our Town
                            Land Charity. We are probably a very different style of parish
                            from Oxley – mostly small farmers &amp; not one resident gentleman – a
                            pretty general objection prevails to much schooling, &amp; a universal
                            one to allotments – I am very fond of carrying on business by Tickets,
                            &amp; send you three, which I think you have not seen before, which will
                            explain themselves – This sort of interchange of plans may often be
                            mutually instructive – I must look at the B.hp of Norwich’s Book named
                            by you – I have engaged to give an opening address to the Ipswich Museum
                            on the 6th &amp; have also a lecture in hand from our Hadleigh Farmers’
                            Club on the Geographic distribution of Alimentary Plants, which are
                            engaging all my spare time just now to get them ready –</p>
                        <p>Believe me</p>
                        <p>very truly &amp; faithfully yours</p>
                        <p>J. S. Henslow</p>
                        <p>P. S. one of the farmers yesterday sent a male Reed Bunting to know what
                            it was – It was in winter plumage – &amp; another today brought me a
                            large mass of Quartzvein attached to sandstone. – The registration of
                            such events wd. certainly tell in illustration of the matters unusual in
                            particular districts–</p>
