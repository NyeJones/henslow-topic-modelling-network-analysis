                  <p>As you were so good as to request towards the close of last year that I would get some tin Boxes made for the purpose of transmitting Plants, I have herewith sent you 6 which I think will be just what you required–</p>
                  <p>I am going on the 9 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> inst. to see Dale where I shall remain a fortnight &amp; I hope about Midsummer nothing will prevent our going to Scotland in pursuit of our favorite object Entomology, we <del>expect to be</del> propose being absent 2 months during which time I expect we shall do wonders; I see how much of it for Scotland is a country that every one who has any taste for fine scenery, antiquities or scenes rendered interesting from their important events that have transpired there cannot fail to be gratified, &amp; being so fortunate as to have not only an agreeable companion but one who is devoted to Ent <hi rend="superscript">y</hi> is a great thing, indeed I always told Dale that when he could make up his mind to visit Scotland that we would go together &amp; upon mentioning it this Winter he agreed &amp; one object in our visit to Dorset is to make final arrangements for our excursion.</p>
                  <p>Whilst in Suffolk last Autumn I devoted myself to drawing plants, indeed I was compelled to do so to carry me through the winter &amp; I have now only the following remaining but expect to add a little to my stock in Dorsetshire.</p> 
                  <p>Agaricus coccineus - Rubus______- Vaccinium myrtillus- Arabis turrita - Verbena officinalis - Cichorium intybus - Lamium purpureum - Delphinium consolidum - Parnassia palustris - Anagallis arvensis - Matrocaria chamomilla -</p> 
                  <p>I have besides</p>
                  <list rend="ordered"> 
                     <item>Aster tripolium</item>

                  </list>
                    
                  <p>Should you favor me with any specimens this year – if you have an opportunity of enclosing <del>any of</del> the following I shall be much obliged as I have Insects for them. Artemisia absinthium – &amp; Cotton Rush</p>
                  <p>Stephens has nothing to send at present otherwise I should have enclosed it–</p>
                  <p>Of course you know that M <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> McLeay is going with his family to New Holland &amp; M <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bicheno a Barrister is – proposed by the President as his successor. I hope that you will come to Town at the Anniversary, to take a part in this election as it is of importance to the welfare of the Society, &amp; I exceedingly regret that I had not the pleasure of seeing you when last in town– there will be also I believe on the 23 <hi rend="superscript">d </hi>May a sale of British, European &amp; Exotic Insects at Thomas’. &amp; if I can send you a catalogue free of expense I will</p>
                  <p>I believe that I have nothing further to communicate. I hope that you approve of my recent labors in the cause of science as much as you did at their commencement &amp; should any thing strike you with regard to the Work at any time you will confer a great favor upon me by telling me your opinion candidly– I am sorry to say that it does not sell as well as I could wish, having lost a great many Subscribers this year – but this is a part over which I have no control, I have been fortunate, too upon the whole in the notice that has been taken of it which together with the great expense I have been at in advertising I expected would have some more for me. I have inserted an advertisement in upwards of 70,000 Prospectuses this year, &amp; you have seen that at last the Zool. Journal has spoken handsomely of the Work, &amp; a very handsome notice was inserted in the Literary Chronicle for the 19 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Feb <hi rend="superscript">.y</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hoping that Mrs Henslow is well &amp; also Mr Jennings to whom I beg you to present my remembrances</p>
                  <p>I remain | my dear Sir yours faithfully | J. Curtis</p>
                  <p>[P.S.] I think I heard that you have taken Orders– If such be the case the Linnean List should be corrected which I shall be happy to do if you will inform me– you will observe that I have moved</p>
