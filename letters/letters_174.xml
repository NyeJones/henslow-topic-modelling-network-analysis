                  <p>I avail myself of the opportunity which M. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Steele’s return to Cambridge presents to send you some specimens of plants which are neither as numerous nor, I regret, so good as I could have wished. During this summer I have as yet had leisure for only one botanical walk, &amp; that was limited to an afternoon so that I have been obliged to employ my pupils to gather specimens, &amp; as they are young in Botany, they often do not succeed in procuring what they are sent for. I hope during what remains of summer to procure many contained in your list, &amp; will transmit by some future opportunity. I have just ascertained that our Oenanthe crocata is not the true plant, but probably the Oen. apiifolia of Hooker, &amp; now that attention has been directed to it I would not wonder if the latter should turn out the more common plant. I am pretty sure that the Tropogon (sic) major is the usual Scottish species, for the Edinburgh Tragopogon is the same as ours, if a specimen of the latter lately sent would allow me to decide.</p>
                  <p>I had hoped to have been able to have sent you by this time the 2 Vol. of my Flora, but the convenience of the printer has detained it a long time in the press. It is I believe all printed with the exception of the Index, so that in a few weeks I shall send it by M. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loudon as originally proposed.</p>
                  <p>I am happy to say that the study is on the increase in our neighbourhood. When I published the first vol. I do not think there was another, with the exception of my friend M. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baird, in the county who paid any attention to the subject. There are now 6 or 7 botanists, or would-bees in the town itself, and several also scattered over the county – so numerous indeed are we that we begin to speak of forming ourselves into a Botanical Club – Society being rather too dignified a denomination for us embryos.</p>
                  <p>I am D. Sir, | with much regard | yours truly | George Johnston</p>
