                        <p>I have only returned this evening to Cambridge &amp; sit down immediately to answer your last. In truth I saw it a week ago when I was here for a day &amp; did what I could in consulting with Whewell &amp; distributing the Recommendations - but I forgot during my [ripped page] away to write to you. I could distribute about 200 Copies in this neighbourhood. I selected those names which I thought most likely to profit by them. Would it not be best whenever you send me anything for distribution to mark a list of names (the printed one for example) with a notice of those to whom <hi rend="underline">I</hi> may circulate (!) &amp; to send similar lists to others - or better still for you to direct the pamphlet or letter as I did the circulars about the lithogy. &amp; then make up packets for the different depots. We are sure to get into some confusion if something of this sort is not done. I hardly know how to advise for Edinburgh - a few generalities must suffice as answers to your queries.</p>
                        <list rend="ordered">
                            <item>{1) The Council of 20 Feb. sd. issue orders in <hi rend="underline">general</hi> &amp; <hi rend="doubleUnderline">all</hi> detail left to the Secretaries who must be allowed carte blanche for every arrangt.- not contradictory to the Council's orders.</item>
                            <item>(2) I am quite willing to forego the 1t week's shooting for Edinburgh (if I can get there) &amp; I sd. think that all scientific sportsmen would say the same.</item>
                            <item>(3) The Cal. Hort. Socy. meeting a good reason for our meeting taking place then.</item>
                            <item>(4) The earlier the announcement the better.</item>
                            <item>(5) Advertizements in lieu of circulars would infallibly succeed in <hi rend="doubleUnderline">thinning</hi> the meeting!</item>
                            <item>(6) Expense of circulars &amp;c. too trifling to make it worthwhile considering the minimum.</item>
                            <item>(7) As for things to be done at morning &amp; evening meetings, Whewell observes that the great point is to have some rules ready for answering objectors to any proposed routine.</item>
                            <item>(8) Oratorial exhibitions not be desired or expected.</item>
                            <item>(9) To franking foreigners I wd. add appointing them <hi rend="underline">seats</hi> at the meeting - &amp; it would be a good plan to have printed bills on the seats appointed for the various officers - it wd. save confusion to keep the fair sex within juster limits than they occasionally observed at Cambridge.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Surely our Northern Brethren, having a good will, need fear nothing about the success of their arrangements - but if Dr Robinson has any queries on particular points I shall be happy at any time to reply to the best of my ability - &amp; now I must conclude with a <hi rend="underline">serious</hi> appeal to your gallantry - where is Miss Jermyn's M.S. - you have my word pledged for its safe delivery. Don't forget to return it as I shall get sadly scolded.</p>
                        <p>Yrs ever truly</p>
