                  <p>I will endeavour to let you have the descriptions of the “Chiasognathus Grantii” if possible by Monday next but at all events during the ensuing week if not ready by the above day – the Plate is in a state of slow growth &amp; I was on the point of writing to you respecting it, as to the “Lettering” &amp; Number of the Plate; also whether the Society has a protecting mark.– “Published by etc” which are necessary to be attended to, before the plate can be printed off. I also want to furnish the printer &amp; colourist with the numbers required – both plain and coloured – and when I have all the particulars <del>ill.del.</del> the plate can be finished.</p>
                  <p>I expected to have described the said beetle long since, but I have had so much to do to work up the arrears of my book, &amp; unfortunately the damp has attacked some of my drawers in so deplorable a manner, that I have lost an immense deal of time in restoring them to their original state (as near as practicable), but many of the delicate species, I fear, are irreparably lost; I must therefore replace what I can during the coming summer.–</p>
                  <p>Your numbers were sent off in due course on the 1 <hi rend="superscript">st</hi>, but as I did not employ my usual messenger (he being engaged on that day) they were probably too late in reaching P.N.Row, as it was an old man that carried them &amp; he could not walk very quick. A Plate of Lepidoptera No. 32 (I believe) is not yet published, it comes out, if possible, with the covers on the 30 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> next.</p>
                  <p>Remember me kindly to L. Jenyns when you see him, his three weeks or a month are a very long time approximately; I will be happy to see him when he does come to town.</p>
                  <p>I am in great haste| yours very truly |J.F.Stephens</p>
