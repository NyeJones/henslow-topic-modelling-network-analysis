                        <p>I have read your letter &amp; all the accompanying papers &amp; I have carefully gone over my notes.</p>
                        <p>The present result in my mind is decidedly that the matter ought to be submitted to the Secretary of State - which may be done either by a direct application to him or by sending it to me that I may forward it - which I shall certainly do - (perhaps the latter may be the more favourable mode of bringing it under the notice of the Secretary of State).</p>
                        <p>I am not immediately prepared to express any opinion on the subject beyond this - that in the present state of the criminal-law every facility ought to be given to the discovery of error &amp; the correction of mistake - in the present instance in the only evidence agt. riches is the direct positive testimony of Mrs Golding as to his <hi rend="underline">identity</hi> - that is a description of testimony frequently found to be (however honest) very wrong - the occasion was one of considerable alarm &amp; excitement, &amp; there were other sources of error - in favour of an accused person I think all moral grounds for believing his innocence ought to be considered - on the whole it seems to me that the whole case as it stands ought to be submitted to the [text illegible] authority &amp; judgement of the Secretary of State - &amp; I am willing (nay desirous) of either forwarding a petition to Sir Geofrey or being referred to by him. </p>

                        <p>P. S. I may add that the absence of any appearance of violence on the Person of Riches was a favourable circumstance not to be overlooked</p>
