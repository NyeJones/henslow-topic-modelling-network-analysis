                  <p>I sent you a copy of my Apparatus Report as soon as it was printed, but I now enclose another in case the former may have been lost.</p>
                  <p>You will see p43 that under the head of Botany we give a Magic Lantern with slides containing real objects. These slides are suggested by Home &amp; Thornthwaite and one or two which they had got up to show me were extremely good. Thornthwaite offered to get up any series that should be ordered. How can you help me here? Can you give me a List of suitable objects such as shall really illustrate Botany &amp; Vegetable Physiology systematically? A couple of dozen would I think be about enough to make such a List.</p>
                  <p>Many thanks for the notice of all your grand doings. Did they go home singing “He’s a jolly good fellow.” or were they too far gone for that?</p>
                  <p>Yours very truly | F Temple</p>
                  <p>I am delighted with the Papers in the Gardener’s Chronicle, but I hope they will be soon exhumed; they are buried there</p>
