                  <p>I send you a paper from Blackwood sent to me by Prof Rogers which — if you have not seen it, will probably interest you.</p>
                    <p>I have had no “Show” this year for several reasons and it is well that I did not. There would have been nothing to show — and wet weather to show it in[.] I have noticed that in this locality the season has been peculiarly favourable to the oak. Large and old trees have thrown up long shoots from near the extremities of their branches[.] These shoots are invariably perpendicular however pendent the parent branch may be[.] Some trees are covered with these outbursts of vigour[.] The Larch on the dry Mountain Limestone has also had a fine time of it this year. Many trees of all sorts are much cut up on the West side from the strong West winds that prevailed[.] Nothing however seems to affect either the <hi rend="italic">Wellingtonia</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Araucaria imbricata</hi>, both of which appear to have established themselves in circumstances of considerable comfort.</p>
                  <p>Volunteering is holding on prosperously and well, and the shooting is becoming quite a rage.</p>
                  <p>Believe me | yours very truly | Ducie</p>
