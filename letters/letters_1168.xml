                        <p>Your kindness and energy are positively painful to me. Attached in your double capacity of Antiquarian &amp; Natural Philosopher it is hard to decline - but I will shew "upon my honour" why I have never solicited admission to the Royal Society. I have always considered the postage of three letters F. R. S. somewhat too high for my pocket; and being one who am very seldom in London I could not take advantage of any personal introductions to which it might give rise. If I had the opportunity of being oftener in London I should delight in belonging to the Royal, Astronomical, Microscopical &amp; 1/2 a doz. other societies - and should be a pretty constant frequenter of them all. If I had not my Boys education still before me I could spare a 50£ to pay down my commutation money - but I have already so many odd sovereigns to pay annually to this &amp; that society that I shrink from incurring the amount. I have not a few calls upon me locally - &amp; I have made up my mind for some time past to concentrate my little energies nearer home, &amp; do what I can in a small way to promote (or [illegible]) the study of natural history in the neighbourhood. If ever I feel myself somewhat more at liberty, as my Boys grow up, &amp; income increases I shall certainly not forget your offer to propose me - but just at present I must "on my honour &amp; conscience together" reject the temptation. I shall not refuse your kind offer of the <hi rend="underline">reports</hi> by McKay. I sleep at his house on Friday, but must be in Hitcham before 11 ocl Saturday. His firm are about to give a dinner (on Friday) to their workmen - a party of 1200 expected - &amp; I would not willingly lose the sight, though I am much pressed for time just now.</p>
                        <p>Believe me</p>
                        <p>Most truly and sincerely yrs</p>
