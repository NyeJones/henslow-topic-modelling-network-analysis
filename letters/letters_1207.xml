                        <p>I was not aware or had forgotten that you were no longer a member of our Socy. - &amp; feel the greater pleasure at receiving a subscription (especially so handsome a one) from you. I think we shall now raise the money. We have turned the 200£ since the circular was sent &amp; are in expectation of several more money. L. Jenyns will thank you for the hints you send respecting the Ringouzel &amp; sandmartin. I am truly vexed that we did not meet at Rochester. I hunted, myself, for the Locust but could neither see nor hear any thing of him. I know his call well &amp; sd. have found one if he had been there. I suppose like many other insects these periods of plenty are uncertain. The first time I caught it, I took about 20 or 30 in the same field - most of which I gave to Leach. I have heard from Leach twice this year, from Rome. He sent me a small packet of plants by Dr Goodall. His letters are quite collected. L. Jenyns has added some good things to the Cambridge Insects this year but he is not here to enumerate them. I am very busy just now preparing to examine the "όι πολλοί". So good bye</p>
