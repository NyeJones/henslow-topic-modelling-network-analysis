                  <p>On returning this evening from the good city of Winchester where I have been on a visit to the Dean with a view of making arrangements for our Congress in Sept. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> I found your kind letter and your brothers, who sends me his name for the list of annual Subscribers and assures me that your own is coming— I rejoice to hear it, for I had been on the point of writing to you, fearing you might take Roach Smith, who is a zealous intelligent excellent fellow, as a sample of his party. I sincerely regret losing him, but he has taken a strong bias in favor of certain persons with whom the majority of our old Committee will not and cannot act again— It is no rivality or jealousy as they affect to shew but a straightforward consideration of maintaining principle and honorable conduct against the perversion of public purposes to private interests. I have too high an opinion of Smiths character and integrity to say anything in reproach to him, and I regret what has occurred but it has been inevitable. Where principle is concerned there can be no compromise</p>
                  <p>I hope that next time you have any discoveries or drawings to communicate you will favor me with them— and I am specially interested about the cinerary urns which occupy your notice, and should be much pleased to put any new types into our Journal[.] But pray let me have your name and come to Winchester in the third week in Sept. <hi rend="superscript">r </hi>and take part in our primeval section, and open some barrows on the Hampshire hills, &amp; see if their urns are like your Suffolk discoveries—</p>
                  <p>I should be delighted to run down and see you but I am not able to get away between the Antiquaries &amp; the Archaeological[.] Pray observe that they have the quarrel all on their side— We have not been able to withhold an expression of dissatisfaction, which they have made a casus belli and they have all the squabbling on their side. We maintain our straightforward quiet course, and are supported by all whose opinion we value, amongst whom I would anxiously hope to number yourself, so send me your name and something for the Journal hereafter as occasion may occur. Let Smith have the present lot if you choose it. I shall not grudge them. I wish them no ill, and only lament that they have not Smith’s integrity.</p>
                  <p>The Master of Trinity has joined our Central Committee and promised to take part at Winchester on the Architectural section— We much want Primevals, and your presence will be very valuable on that occasion.</p>
                  <p>Believe me | yours very truly | Albert Way</p>
