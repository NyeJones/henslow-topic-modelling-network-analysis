                  <p>It is indeed a very long time, that I owe an answer to your last very obliging &amp; friendly letter; but I hope you will pardon me, when I promise not to do so in futurity.</p>
                  <p>The bearer of this is Professor Friedländer of Halle, who intends to make some months's stay in England. If he has time enough to dispose of, he will visit Cambridge. Should you have any opportunity of directing him to subjects which may be worth his attention, you will add one obligation more to the many ones which bind me to you.</p>
                  <p>The plants you sent me with your last letter have very much pleased me and I have put aside some other specimens for you which I shall send you together with some additional ones and the second specimen of my paper on the Pyrola at the end of the summer.</p>
                  <p>It gave me great joy, to hear of your marriage by a Cambridge gentleman who favoured me with his visit for some minutes, but whose name I have lost. I should be very glad once to see you and your fair partner at Leipzig, and I hope it would not be quite exempt of every interest to visit the continent for some months. In the mean time I request you to present my most respectful compliments to Mrs Henslow and to Professor Whewell.</p>
                  <p>Believe me</p>
                  <p>Sir</p>
                  <p>Yours very sincerely</p>
                  <p>J. Radius</p>
                  <p>PS. Any letters or paquets which you intend to send to me, direct to Mr Baillière, bookseller, 3 Bedford str, Bedford Square, London. </p>
