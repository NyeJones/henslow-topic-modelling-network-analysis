                        <p>I must thank you for the 2 papers – the accounts in which have much
                            interested me – but positions [opportunities?] are very different in regard
                            to those we try to aid – but these mutual [hints?] suggest thoughts which
                            each may turn to his advantage in the common cause – I dare say there are
                            many who will say my alluding to Dicotyledons is overdoing the thing –
                            but in drawing up Programmes I have respect for all classes as well the
                            uninstructed among the educated , as the non-educated. – True for one,
                            true for another – The terms in which great generalizations are conveyed
                            ought to become household words – I have separately asked 3 of the 4
                            little Botanists of my School, whom I took to Cambridge, what they liked
                            best – &amp; each replied – they could not tell, as every thing was so
                            interesting – on asking what would you wish to see again, if I said I
                            could take you see only one of the objects you saw – they each
                            immediately said the “Botanic Garden”, &amp; in a way that convinced me
                            this was their preference – acquainted as they are with the grouping of
                            our wild flowers they readily understood the merits of our classifying
                            all plants into natural groups, &amp; could appreciate what they saw in
                            the Garden more than they could of the architecture of the buildings
                            however striking – I have been interested in hearing what different
                            parties preferred – the Pork-butcher exceedingly admired the buildings,
                            but his chief preference was the anatomical museum, &amp; the wax models
                            of subjects under dissection! Several mistook these for real subjects,
                            &amp; one asked if one was wax, or a newly killed [letter cut]</p>
