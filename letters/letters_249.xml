                  <p>The clearing away [?] after the party here alluded to, and going to Bury yesterday prevented my replying immediately. I have hunted up the stray Hasselquist and Taxidermy and they shall be restored to their rightful shelves the first opportunity. How I ever transferred them to Hitcham I can't think, but suppose their <hi rend="underline">backs</hi> had become so familiar that I did not recognize them as strangers to my library. Your plant is Melissa (not Melittis) grandiflora. I am grieved to hear of the probable necessity of your carrying your wife to warmer winter quarters. I shd. like to get to Birmingham if I can but it is very doubtful. Darwin's a V.P. We have good accounts from Harriet. I lost my larvae of Velleius, but have bred 2 Diptera (a Volucella and another which I found Parasitic in the Wasps' nest, I made the Velleius too moist from overcare.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Henslow expects a large party (more than 300 came) of the Young Men's Association of Ipswich to visit him on Monday next the 25th, when he will exhibit Nests of the Hornet, Wasps, Humble Bees, and some other specimens of Natural History, from 4 to 8 o'clock. At 6 o'clock he proposes making some remarks on the objects exhibited.</p>
                  <p>He will be happy to see any of his parishioners on the occasion, and Miss Henslow will have Tea prepared in the Rectory for the Farmers' Ladies at 7 o'clock.</p>
                  <p>Should the Day prove unfavourable, the party will be postponed to Tuesday the 26th.</p>
                  <p>All went off pleasantly, the Farmers of Hadleigh forwarded them in 10 Wagons and the Cavalcade was astounding to the senses of the Villagers.</p>
