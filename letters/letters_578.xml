                  <p>I have this afternoon forwarded to London my little box which I fear may contain more rubbish than you may care to unpack. We find our poor people glad to receive as ornaments to their houses what is too bad for our Museums; and perhaps what I have sent you may in great measure find its way there. The children of our schools brought me some of the things as their parents obtain them in their work. I am afraid you will laugh at the illustration I have sent of vegetable Ivory but the turner who gave me the specimens of wood is so very proud of his humming tops that I could not resist the pleasure of putting in a specimen of his work. I believe we delight as much as any children in the graceful movements of the little thing. Any specimens not marked are from Budleigh Salterton in Devonshire as also the pebbles. Which look very well when varnished, &amp; which furnish good illustrations of conglomerates. My sister has taken the liberty of sending you by this opportunity a little book which she has complied &amp; finally composed and just as I was closing the box we received an article of my brother William which I thought you might like to look at. I have not yet read it but I know its object which is one we have earnestly at heart feeling that as ?? we all ought to do something to check a habit which takes the power from so many to receive the blessings of Charity[.] I must thank you very much for your last letter which did us all good, expressing so completely the feelings we wish to entertain</p>
                  <p>Believe me to be very respectfully yours | Anna Carpenter.</p>
