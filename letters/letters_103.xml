                  <p>I regret I had not the pleasure of seeing you before your last departure from S <hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Albans. The more so, as I particularly wished your opinion upon 2 or 3 botanical questions, of some importance to my present studies. One of these, however, more important than the others, I shall now trouble you with. Botanists, I believe, generally admit the three great divisions of the Vegetable world to be natural; namely Dicotyledones, Monocotyledones, and Acotyledones. It appears, however, that other Botanists, among whom M <hi rend="superscript">srs</hi> Fries and Agardh stand conspicuous, conceive that the last named division, is much too comprehensive, and have therefore divided the Acotyledones, into three Classes, or groups, of equal value with the Dicotyledones &amp; Monocotyledones, naming them―Protophyta, Hysterophyta and Pseudo-cotyledonea. How far have these <del>preceding</del> latter divisions of the Vegetable Kingdom been adopted? and where are the reasons, for or against their admission to be found? Next, I would enquire, are there real certain groupes or genera, or species, among the Acotyledones, which, in their nature, partake so much of those characters belonging to Pseudo-cotyledones, and to the Hysterophyta, or Fungi, that some doubts may be reasonably entertained under which they should be arranged? or at least, that their immediate affinities, to one or the other, are real, at first sight, unquestionably apparent? If so; what <del>genera</del> are the [<hi rend="underline">over </hi> 
                     <del>genera</del>] names of these genera or species.</p>
                  <p>I shall feel particularly obliged by as many details, as your time or inclination will allow you to give me upon this interesting subject and if you have no objection I should wish to mention your name as the source of my authority as these questions relate to an earlier portion of my Introduction to the second Volume of the "Northern Zoology," I shall be most thankful to receive your communication at your earliest convenience.</p>
                  <p>In referencing the foregoing queries I think it better, perhaps, to put the principal question in aother shape. Is there not a greater apparent affinity between the Pseudocotyledones and the Hysterophyta. than there is between either the first and the Dicotyledones? or between the Hysterophyta and the Monocotyledones?</p>
                  <p>I send you the Prospectus of a Botanical work for which I entreat the patronage of your circle of friends at Cambridge, on behalf of the fair painter of Lilies. I can safely say that if it is published the excellence of the Plates will exceed any that either England or France have produced. I have no other than a friendly interest in its success and therefore beg for Subscriptions without any shame.</p>
                  <p>I have thought the first volume of my Illustrations might go in the Packet and be a subject of interest at your next Scientific Party. It is a select copy, and should any one desire the purchase you could bring me the <hi rend="underline">proceeds</hi> when next you visit S <hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Albans.</p>
                  <p>I had the pleasure of seeing your brother in law Mr Jenyns about 10 days ago but very much regretted his visit was but for a few minutes. The Season has now made me a Greenhouse Plant and a visit to St. Albans assumes all the hardships of a journey to the polar regions.</p>
                  <p>Believe me my d <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sir | Very faith <hi rend="superscript">ly</hi> yours | W. Swainson</p>
                  <p>[P.S.] You will perceive I have completely baffled the expectations of <hi rend="underline">Public Libraries </hi>as to free copies of the “Lilies”. They may claim the <hi rend="underline">letter press</hi> but have no right to a mere collection of Plates.</p>
                  <p>[in pencil] Would it be drawing too much upon your good nature to request you to place some of the Prospecti with your Cambridge Bookseller?</p>
