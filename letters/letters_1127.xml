                        <p>Will you be so good as to correct an omission in the Hitcham List. Above chenopodianths should be inserted</p>
                        <p>Sect. 4. Incomplete</p>
                        <p>which escaped notice in looking over the proof.</p>
                        <p>Bentham expressly intended his book for beginners, &amp; others who are not likely to become profound in Botany. I have become so thoroughly satisfied of the great advantage of introducing Botany into Village School - that I devote every Monday to the subject - &amp; I think if you were some day to favour me with a visit you would see at once how useful it can be made. I will send by this post a document or two which will show you the manner in which attempt to <hi rend="underline">work it</hi> in with other subjects. On Tuesday (if fine) all hands (about 3 doz. volunteers) will turn into our wood, &amp; thoroughly search it. If every Village in England had a battery of sharp eyes what an accumulation to be digested for the Cybele! You would find it difficult to puzzle my chief pupil Teacher in regard to the name &amp; classification of a Hitcham species - &amp; she would tell you the Order of most of our common garden plants - in to the bargain. It is in School work that I expect Bentham's book will ultimately prove most useful. But when shall we have School work in Botany?</p>
                        <p>We had a famous day for our Hort. Show on Wednesday. The produce better than I ever saw it before. It has been continually improving. Nearly 300 of the peasants sat down to tea &amp; more peaceable &amp; well behaved set it is hardly possible to meet with.</p>
                        <p>Yrs very truly</p>
