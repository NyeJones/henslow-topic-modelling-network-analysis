                        <p>I send you Mr Teale's drawings as you may wish to make arrangements about them, if you think they ought to be engraved. Without seeing the specimens I can hardly tell what to make of them - but they appear to be undescribed. Perhaps you may have an opportunity of looking more into the question. Be so good as to let me have his letter again. I am daily expecting your novelties &amp; plates. I did not answer your last as I was very busy in Cambridge - but I now present you many thanks for your exertions about the paper. Your description with the account I read in the Encyclopedia &amp; some vague recollections have enabled me to understand the process I think completely. I shall endeavour to look over a paper mill near St Albans where I hope to be about July 9. I shall be absent from here from July 7th to 17th - having to examine at the Univy. of London &amp; then attend the August meeting at Cambridge - after that I shall probably not stir till the Glasgow meeting.</p>
                        <p>Can you send me notices of <hi rend="doubleUnderline">any</hi> papers that may have appeared in our Journals or other-wise on Fossil Bot. I have not an accurate list myself. Someone mentioned a recent paper in (I think) the Nat. H. Magazine where <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the described species were referred to. When I go to Cambridge I will hunt for it, if you cannot refer me offhand to it. I will give you a programme of projected Village Lectures in case any thing should chance to occur in which you can help me.</p>
