                  <p>By an advertisement in the Times I learn that the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society Cirencester intend after Xmas to establish a School for Boys under 17 as in-students of the College. A Clergyman is wanted as Principal. I am very anxious to be in a drier climate than this, a more scientific neighbourhood, &amp; within reasonable distance of London &amp; the Universities &amp; this appointment would suit me in every way. At the same time an Experience of upwards of 15 years in Tuition &amp; the management of Boys assures me that I could undertake it in the confident anticipation of success &amp; the approval of the Council.</p>
                  <p>I do not yet know who forms the Council, but I take the liberty of writing this early to yourself to solicit your kind interference in my behalf should you know who the members of it are &amp; if you are personally acquainted with any of them.</p>
                  <p>I received last week a letter from my uncle Professor Cumming &amp; was very glad to learn that at his age he is so strong &amp; well &amp; able for his duties. I had a good report also of M. <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Cumming &amp; the young ladies.</p>
                  <p>Believe me, Dear Sir | Very faithfully yrs | J G Cumming</p>
