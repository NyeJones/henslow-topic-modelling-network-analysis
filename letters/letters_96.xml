                  <p>Accept my best thanks, Dear Sir, for your kind present, which I received yesterday― but too late to allow of my acknowledging the rec <hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> of them by that day's Post. Your letter, too, promises farther assistance, deserves &amp; has my unfeigned gratitude. I could almost regret your muscological treasures being so far advanced, as it prevents my doing so much as I am bound to do:― In some few instances, however, I can add to your collection; &amp; you shall have <hi rend="underline">every Jungermannia I possess</hi>. During the progress of Hooker's beautiful &amp; excellent work, I attended to them, as well as other genera; &amp; those I shall send as of my own gathering. Funaria Muhlenbergii I was the first to detect, in England. I think Botanists seem disposed to make it a var. of F: hygometrica― &amp;, in good truth, there is little beyond habit to separate them. Our Friend Hooker will play the devil amongst <hi rend="underline">now admitted species, or </hi> am much mistaken in him; &amp; I think science can suffer nothing by making <del>these</del> many into <hi rend="underline">varieties</hi>, till some incontrovertible distinction shall be discovered, entitling them to the dignity of species. In the genera of Rubus― Rosa― Carex &amp; Salix, much may be done, without violence, in this way. The fashion of splitting hairs is not a good one, tho' adopted by Lindley <hi rend="underline">now</hi>, &amp; by poor Smith <hi rend="underline">lately</hi>:― but, in publishing Eng: Botany, everything was admitted which c <hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> add a plate, &amp; that plate put 6 <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> in the Editor's pocket. Smith, in his last publication, endeavors to uphold his former work; and how far he has succeeded, I will not presume to discuss with the Professor of Botany.</p>
                  <p>I see you quote <hi rend="underline">Hinton</hi>, as the station of the beautiful Athamanta. I could go to the spot, if it be in <hi rend="underline">Ray's Field</hi> as well as to that of Lonicera caprifolium &amp; Viburnum lantana All were planted there by Relhan; at least he owned this with Athamanta, &amp; did not disown it as to the others. He was a slippery chap― but we must allow him the benefit of that humbugging "de mortuis nil nisi bonum", upon which too many have the claim of charity. I can send you some Swiss plants, &amp; shall have much pleasure in doing so. My life has been uniformly retired(?), &amp; no opportunity of studying Exotic Botany, worth adoption, has ever presented itself. Iam frumit nose! &amp; our native productions are full as much as I ever attend to. With those, however, I can still be very busy, &amp; my heart is as warm as ever towards those who will acknowledge me as a fellow-laborer, &amp; assist my now uniformly retarded progress. I will not despair, Dear Sir, of seeing you thus far north; &amp;, with true old English sincerity, promise you a cordial welcome, &amp; a Bottle of the best (not bad) I have. In the consumption of this, or even more, ever worthy Macfarlan will lend a hand: &amp;, were he here now, would, I am sure, beg to be remembered with all &amp; every profession of Friendship.</p>
                  <p>I am, Dear Sir, your sincere &amp; much obliged Friend | James Dalton</p>
                  <p>With the exception of about 3 acres of Pyrola rotundifol: we have hardly a plant worth notice in this cold-clay-country.</p>
