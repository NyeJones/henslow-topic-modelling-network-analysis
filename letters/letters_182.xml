                    <p>I found your letter on my arrival here &amp; feel more &amp; more soothed &amp; comforted as I learn your opinion of my beloved Marmaduke– I think it will be as well to procure a catalogue of the effects, that is; a list of every thing except the books could easily be made up. I shall be greatly obliged to you getting a <hi rend="underline"> bookseller</hi> to draw up a catalogue of the books – perhaps there may be some made of mentioning the quantity of wine. Perhaps Skinner sh’ be applied to for a statement of the Intms account &amp; I think it probable he may expect me to write to him w. <hi rend="superscript">h</hi> I feel disposed to do– I found in looking over his mem: of a will that he appointed no executor. The only three persons named are my brother William now on the coast Africa my sister &amp; myself – so that the arranging of everything will devolve upon me nearly as much as if I had been named Executor. I am much pleased with the observations you have made regarding the clock. It has occurred to me that his print or prints by Wilkie might form a good substitute, but of course any other rem <hi rend="superscript">ce. </hi>you prefer , you will mention– I mention the Wilkie because it is a good thing &amp; in your mind associated with his room–</p>
                  <p>Might it not be as well to get bills sent in, as Bookseller’s book’s, tailors &amp;c I will write to Stulty. I do not apprehend that our libraries had many books in common. The Edinb: Per: is I know a duplicate work but I think it w. <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be a good present for one of his brothers. At any rate I sh. <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be obliged by you getting a person accustomed to the work to make a catalogue. Bathurst’s letter has pleased me from the testimony it contains to Maramaduke’s character &amp; pained me for the acknowledgement of his own unworthiness. I do not in the least degree understand in what his demerit consisted &amp; shall therefore be guided entirely by your advice, should I be called upon, to act, at all where he is concerned– <del>I</del>
                  </p>
                  <p>I regret much to hear of your anxiety on account of a brother’s state of health – be assured of every good &amp; kind wish for you on my part and that I am</p>
                  <p>With great regard | yours very sincerely | E.B. Ramsay</p>
