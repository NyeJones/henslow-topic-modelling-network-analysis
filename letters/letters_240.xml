                  <p>Sedgwick put the same quere to me as you have done respecting the transmutation of species – &amp; my reply must be the same– No Botanist, so far as I am aware, gives any credit to the tale– How the results have been obtained (in the 2 or 3 cases out of many that have been tried) is a mystery–but possibly some carelessness, or neglect, or even trickery, may have been practised– In the present state of our knowledge I should as soon expect to hear that some one had seen a planet blaze out into a sun– Quere whether your neighbour sowed barley, expecting it to turn to Oats, &amp; then fancied he had sown oats expecting they might change to Barley? Let him sow 50 grains of Oats &amp; mark each spot, &amp; <hi rend="underline">keep his secret</hi>, lest some one should wish to quiz him &amp; sow a few grains of barley between– It would be unwise to assert that no grain from the Mummy pits ever did or could germinate–but I have commented in the Gardener's Chronicle upon the only <hi rend="underline">very good</hi> case of which we have any account, &amp; have shown the extreme probability than [<hi rend="underline">sic</hi>] an error had crept in– Your neighbour is certainly mistaken in supposing the well known Egyptian wheat, (the <hi rend="underline">Blè de miracle</hi> of the French) to be the same as that which is stated to have been raised from the Mummy wheat– See what I have said in the G.C. FOR 1846.p.757. reading <hi rend="underline">Reves</hi> for <hi rend="underline">Revel</hi>-wheat, which is an misprint– We continue to hear very favorable accounts of Mrs H. whom I hope to see back again in 3 or 4 weeks– She talks of taking Kew in her way, to be introduced to Sir W. &amp; Lady Hooker, whose son D <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jos. has become engaged to Fanny, tho' we do not expect they can be married for a year or two– as he will <hi rend="underline">probably</hi> have to make a voyage to the E. Indies first– He hast just left us– Louisa is at S <hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Albans, &amp; the 2 Boys go to school tomorrow– So I am alone with F. &amp; A– &amp; must keep at home for the present– I have been away too much lately–</p>
                  <p>Kind regards to Mrs Whewell– | Ever y <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> most truly | J S Henslow</p>
