                  <p>I think Mr Jenyns' Observations on the Ornithology of Cambridgeshire well worthy of being printed.</p>
                  <p>As you have requested me to make any remarks that may occur to me, I take the liberty of mentioning a few things which have struck me during the hasty perusal which I have been able to give to his observations.</p>
                  <p>Under the head Insectivori the Cinereous shrike is said to have been shot at Melbourne. This is a mistake – it was found recently killed probably by a hawk. Would it not be advisable to state that this bird feeds on birds and mice as well as insects. It swallows small birds and mice entire.</p>
                  <p>The accentor alpinus was not shot in my garden but in the open space immediately under the last window of the Chapel.</p>
                  <p>The Boarula [?] often appears in Octr: or earlier on our lawn and in the field on the other side the river.</p>
                  <p>I have known 3 or four Martins stay about the South side of Clare Hall till the 18th of Novr.</p>
                  <p>I have seen a single swift for many successive days about our chapel during the early part of Septr. I do not know if it be worth recording that a considerable number of a Covey of partridges bred in the neighbourhood of Clayhithe were perfectly white.</p>
                  <p>A Stone curlew in its first feathers was brought to me alive about two years ago which I was told was bred very near Cambridge.</p>
                  <p>The Crane used to breed in England. Turner page 48. says apud Anglos etiam nidulantur grues in locis palustribus et eorum (vipiones) – young cranes – saepissime vidi. He does not mention the Cambridge fens, but probably alludes to them, As for what he says respecting the siskin he was acquainted with the country about Cambridge.</p>
                  <p>I have known five or six whimbrels offered for sale at Cambridge.</p>
                  <p>A solitary snipe also was brought to market some time since, but was too much mutilated by shot to be fit for stuffing.</p>
                  <p>The Gallinula Baillonii was caught alive at Melbourne [?].</p>
                  <p>I have been informed by a person who frequents the market that the coot is often sold in the Cambridge market.</p>
                  <p>Anser ferus</p>
                  <p>A. Segetum</p>
                  <p>A. albifrons</p>
                  <p>A. Bernicla</p>
                  <p>As far as my experience extends I cannot agree in the frequent appearance of most of these birds in the Cambridge market. More than ninety in a hundred which are sold there I believe to be Bean Geese. I have not yet been able to purchase the Anser ferus. I have not known the albifrons to have been sold there above two or three times nor have I been able to procure from thence either a Brent Goose or a Barnacle both of which are not uncommon in the London markets at some season.</p>
                  <p>Anas Strepera Gadwall I find by a note in my Montagu that two of these birds were offered for sale in Cambridge market, Feb. 25 1824.</p>
                  <p>Anas tadorna Sheldrake not uncommon.</p>
                  <p>I procured only the male on April 1st at Cambridge. I do not know where the female was killed. I have been told that it is not unusual for Cormorants to follow the course of rivers to [damage] great distance from the sea. The Shag never [damage] very rarely quits the Coast.</p>
                  <p>Is not the Sea pie found in Cambridgeshire?</p>
                  <p>Believe me, Dear Sir | yrs very sincerely | G Thackeray</p>
