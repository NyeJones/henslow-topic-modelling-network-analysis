                        <p>A few days ago I had the pleasure of learning from Mr Spring Rice, that he had been engaged with yourself and other zealous promoters of the Diffusion of Knowledge, in establishing a Mechanics Institution at Cambridge: and he added with every prospect of extraordinary success. When this conversation occurred, I had not an opportunity of obtaining many particulars; but I felt persuaded that you would oblige me by sending them, and therefore did not wish to press Mr Rice for that purpose. If either of your Newspapers have published an account of the proceedings, you will I am sure, have the kindness to direct a copy to be sent to me or perhaps you will favor me with a slight sketch of the business, if your professional avocations will permit; and I may have the additional satisfaction of introducing your communication to the public, at the Anniversary meeting of the London Mechanics Instiution which takes place next Wednesday, the twentieth. At Royston too I find that an institution has been formed; and that with a degree of zeal the most encouraging, you actually travelled from Cambridge, to deliver a lecture to the members there. With such an enlightened friend and defender these excellent attempts must succeed; and your example cannot fail to animate to similar exertions, some of the many distinguished individuals by whom you are surrounded.</p>
                        <p>I will thank you to send the accompanying letter to the Master of Corpus. He wrote to me several weeks since, respecting a friend of his who wished to obtain a situation there vacant, and I have never yet had an opportunity of acknowledging the rec.t of his letter.</p>
                        <p>With very great regard, I remain, my dear Sir,</p>
                        <p>very truly &amp; faithfully yours</p>
