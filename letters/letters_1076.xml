                  <p>Captain Fitz Roy is going out to survey the southern coast of Terra del Fuego, &amp; afterwards to visit many of the South Sea Islands &amp; to return by the Indian Archipelago: the vessel is fitted out expressly for scientific purposes, combined with the survey,: it will furnish therefore a rare opportunity for a naturalist &amp; it would be a great misfortune that it should be lost:</p>
                  <p>An offer has been made to me to recommend a proper person to go out as a naturalist with this expedition; he will be treated with every consideration; the Captain is a young man of very pleasing manners (a nephew of the Duke of Grafton), of great zeal in his profession &amp; who is very highly spoken of; if Leonard Jenyns could go, what treasures he might bring home with him, as the ship would be placed at his disposal, whenever his enquiries made it necessary or desirable; in the absence of so accomplished a naturalist, is there any person whom you could strongly recommend: he must be such a person as would do credit to our recommendation</p>
                  <p>Do think on this subject: it would be a serious loss to the cause of natural science, if this fine opportunity was lost</p>
                  <p>The ship sails about the end of Septr.</p>
                  <p>Poor Ramsay! what a loss to us all &amp; particularly to you</p>
                  <p>Write immediately &amp; tell me what can be done</p>

                  <p>My dear Henslow</p>
                  <p>I wrote this letter on Saturday, but I was too late for the Post: What a glorious opportunity this would be for forming collections for our museums: do write to me immediately &amp; take care that the opportunity is not lost</p>
