                  <p>I was in London all yesterday so that I did not receive your letter till the evening. I wish there were any chance of my being able to meet you at Hoxne tomorrow but the distance is too great and I am over head &amp; ears in accounts— Prestwich has only just returned from a visit to M. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gunn in Norfolk so that there is no chance of him either— I don’t know whether he has paid Hoxne a visit this time but think he meant to take Mundersley &amp; Hasboro’— I was obliged to decline going with him— I hope it will not be very long before we come to a hand to hand encounter with the haches— Boucher de Perthes Homme Antedil <hi rend="superscript">n</hi> is certainly a most amusing work of fiction His vivid imagination has certainly done his discovery no good and he ought to be thankful that it is so well received as it is— I had a long letter from him last night but have not yet had time to do more than glance at it— His hieroglyphics require a good deal of pains to decipher them entirely— He seems much disturbed in mind at having missed seeing you at Abbeville and at your letter in the Athen <hi rend="superscript">m</hi> When I have made out the contents I must send the letter on for you to practice upon— unless you will fetch it. In great haste believe me</p>
                  <p>ever yours sincerely | John Evans.</p>
