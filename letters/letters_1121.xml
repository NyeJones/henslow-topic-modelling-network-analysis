                        <p>I have no desire to set a different estimate upon my labours from that which other contributors may set upon theirs - but I have a very great objection to leaving such matters ill defined.</p>
                        <p>We are nearly strangers to each other, &amp; to avoid everything like a misunderstanding, in future, some precise form of engagement seems to me necessary. As this does not appear to be your wish I can only regret that I have said any thing which may have induced you to look to me for co-operation. I mentioned to Prof Miller as much of your intentions as I was acquainted with - but he told me at once that he should decline your offer. I suspect he does not consider the French Gentleman named in your Prospectus sufficiently acquainted with higher branches of Crystallography - but perhaps I have no right to say this. I could not answer your letter yesterday, as it was put into my hands only a few minutes before I left Cambridge. Believe me</p>
                        <p>very faithfully Yrs</p>
