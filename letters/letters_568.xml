                  <p>Many thanks for your letter— I am glad to hear of your safe return and to find that you have had time for so complete a visitation of the points of interest about Abbeville and Amiens— I should much like to meet you and have a good talk over all you have seen, but much as I should like it I do not see any way to get to Hitcham— We leave Aldborough next Tuesday, and on Saturday if Prestwich can manage it I am going with him to Icklingham where I believe some of these “harkes” have been found in the gravel. I hope that we shall both of us be at Aldboro’ on the Monday and need not say how glad we should be if you could join our party— Our address is “Waterloo House”— With regard to the age of the deposits in which these implements are found, it seems to me that their occurrence on both sides of the River Somme &amp; at such a height above its level points to something considerably more than 6000 years ago— how much who can say— but I should like to extend our basis of facts before committing myself to any very positive theory as to their age. Those Hoxne beds were not deposited yesterday— I think the section Prestwich has had made will bring out some curious features about it— I must however talk with you “face to face” about it all— If you cannot come over to Aldboro’ on Monday, is there possibility of your being in London shortly and running down here— I have been writing letters all day so excuse this hurried note &amp; with kind regards</p>
                  <p>believe me | yours very sincerely | John Evans.</p>
                  <p>I suppose you could not join us at Bury at 8.15 on Saturday? It is rather doubtful whether Prestwich can come &amp; if not I shall not.</p>
