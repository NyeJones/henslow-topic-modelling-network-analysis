                  <p>I am quite ashamed to see how long your letter of the 15 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> has remained unanswered. But the fault has <del>has</del> not been entirely mine— I have unfortunately not been at home for some time, &amp; my letters from Ipswich have not been forwarded, so that I have not known your wishes for many hours—</p>
                  <p>It would give me great pleasure if my presence professionally were required at Hitcham and my other engagements permitted. I would  make arrangements [illeg] you at once as you propose on the 4 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi>—but this is a particularly busy time with us—&amp; make up our work before the Christmas exam. <hi rend="superscript">ns</hi>— my time is almost taken up till the 25 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Dec. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> but if you will write to the secretary &amp; request a visit from H. M. Inspector at his earliest convenience I shall be authorized to lay aside as ?? early as possible for seeing you, or to make it fit in with my inspections in your district—</p>
                  <p>I have received, altho’ I have not acknowledged, your periodical account of the many doings of Hitcham— I had serious thoughts of risking enactment as one of the little children who were not to be smuggled under the table—but I imagined that such ignominious treatment might lessen my [illeg] if I visited the parish in a higher capacity. I have seen several of your Papers in the Gardeners’ Chronicle, &amp; can only wish that they may be published in a separate form &amp; circulated fully—I am sure that the more potent your system becomes the more boldly you may exclaim “atere hic (bis?) nisceum.”[illeg]</p>
                  <p>Believe me my dear Sir | yours very truly | W. Campbell</p>
