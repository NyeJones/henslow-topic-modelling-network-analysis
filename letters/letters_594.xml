                  <p>I have read over the various documents which you sent to me, with considerable admiration for the elaborate way in which every parochial institution appears to be administered. A report by the judges is the most valuable hint which I gather from your plans, as such a report may be made the vehicle of much advice and information, and might in years to come be an interesting record of progress and improvement[.] I should be rather ashamed to show my Show to you, for this reason, that I save myself a good deal of trouble by a comparatively lavish expenditure I have no colleagues and no subscriptions thereby saving all accounts. I do not manage to make the Examination so minute as yours, and have to depend a little on the honesty of the people, and the probability of their neighbours disclosing any unfair practices. However as yet I have never heard a word of complaint, and these shows as far as they have gone have I believe yielded increased satisfaction both to the Exhibitors and myself.</p>
                  <p>I shall take the liberty of sending you this years statement when it is completed</p>
                  <p>Believe me | yours very truly | Ducie</p>
                  <p>P.S. I enclose my annual notice before the Show.</p>
