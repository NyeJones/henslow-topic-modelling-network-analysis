                  <p>I grieve to tell you that Wrench after giving cause to think that he should give a vote to Palmerston, has pledged himself to Goulburn as well as to Copley.</p>
                  <p>We have 10 votes today including those you sent up. C. Grant brought three of them. He and his brother and Sir Thos. illeg are making themselves very useful indeed. C. Grant has heard from Elliott who will not pledge his 2nd. vote, his first he certainly gives to Goulburn-</p>
                  <p>I hope to get down to Brighton tomorrow, but cannot say positively I shall do so, I am so plagued with cough. But I shall positively be at Cambridge on Friday next, and I will thank you to beg of my nephew to have my rooms got ready by that time. If the cheeses about which I have bored you so often and about which I have heard nothing are not yet sent off, I would not have any sent to me.</p>
                  <p>I inclose a letter for my nephew, left at his brother's lodgings.</p>
                  <p>If you send me a list of the donors illeg illeg not do so.</p>
                  <p>Ever yrs faithfully</p>
                  <p>Carrighan, A.</p>
