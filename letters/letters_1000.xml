                    <p>I have heard from Sir H. &amp; have <hi rend="underline">suggested</hi> Wednesdays &amp; Fridays for 2 weeks in - 4 lectures on June 6,8: 13,15: I could then run up to Kew on the Tuesdays &amp; have that day &amp; Thursdays for selecting specimens &amp; illustrations. His letter is dated 25th, but it only came to hand this morning. He tells me you &amp; Lindley are elected Examiners. I held a <hi rend="underline">sub-committee</hi> at the Ray on Wednesday to discuss the projected programme for the Botany- &amp; we settled it pretty much as we had predetermined, only shortening a little some of the details - our visiting seems to have set in. I dine today with the Club <hi rend="underline">[illeg]</hi> "family", &amp; then go with Le Mott to Trinity Lodge. Tomorrow we dine with Master of St. Johns, Tuesday with Prof. Brown, Wednesday with Prof. Selwyn. No more quiet evenings I suspect. We drank tea yesterday with the Barnards &amp; found Annie all right again after a day's uncomfortablenous. You quite forgot the "Special small papers". What shall I say to Lady Afflick ? I recommended that these really interesting speculations on Phylotaxis, Bee-cells etc. should be collected &amp; published in the form of a miscellany - &amp; I think Whewell will do this. I am sadly grieved to see the death of Lady C. Kerrison. This is a serious loss to the Neighbourhood of Eye, &amp; I am pained for my little protogee at the School there. I know no Lady, among the few I do know, of her position so amiable &amp; painstaking for <hi rend="underline">good</hi>. Lyell writes me that Murchison &amp; Prestwich consider the gravel at the higher &amp; lower levels at Amiens to be contemporaneous. This would quite agree with the suggestion I have thrown out in regard to the deposits at Stowmarket - but the explanation requires something of a  <hi rend="underline">debacle</hi> to which Lyell objects. </p>
