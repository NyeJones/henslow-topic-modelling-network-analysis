                  <p>The Suffolk Archaeologiae have requested me to read a paper at their next meeting on the flint implements found in the Post Pleocene drift— I have several specimens lent me by Prestwich who was here a few days since— I hear you have lately been to Amiens returned laden with specimens— if so I should much like to see them if you will be at home on Monday I should much enjoy an hours chat with you if you will be at Hitcham— I am residing at Grundisburgh Hall— a place just suited to a man with ten children— if you are not engaged on the 24. <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> will you come to the meeting of the Suffolk Institute— I inclose your programme— I rather expect the Rev. Canon Marsden of Great Oakley who would be delighted to meet you I am sure— but I cant promise you any great archaeological treat except in the inspection of some extraordinary antiquities collected by the late surgeon of this village M. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Acton— they are really worth inspecting— There is also a very fair Collection of Geological specimens from the Suffolk Coprolite diggings— I fear that our mad friend Whincopp of Woodbridge wont let us see his “fruits” but his collection is well worth even the bore of going thro’ it with him—</p>
                  <p>I suppose that the facts as stated by Prestwich of the Amiens flints remains</p>
                  <p>“That they are of undoubted human workmanship—</p>
                  <p>“That they are formed in undisturbed gravel”</p>
                  <p>“That they are associated with remains of extinct Mammalia”</p>
                  <p>“That the period of their deposit was Post-Pliocene — anterior to the surface of the country opening its present outline so far at least as its minor features are concerned therefore that man was present at last great catastrophe</p>
                  <p>I suppose in fact that the Hoxne beds are the <del>age of</del> debris of the old face of the country when its features had more of the Lagoon character about it than at present in this district— Grundisburgh is on the Boulder Clay that I am on the look out for something similar here I assure you— Prestwich called me to go to Hoxne with him last week with Evans and Flower but I was unfortunately engaged—</p>
                  <p>I have a green old place here in a Park of sixty Acres but nothing worthy a visit of the Institute altho’ in Programme— I shall read my paper in Woodbridge its only a ten minute affair*</p>
                  <p>yours faithfully | R. Rolphe</p>
                  <p>*to call the attention of members to the fact that these remains of the Post-Pleiocene era [illeg] exist in [illeg] of their own parishes at their own doors if they would but look out for them</p>
                  <p>I can give you a bed at Grundisburgh &amp; [illeg] welcome whenever you can come as if you can’t come on the 24 <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I wish you would come &amp; see what can be done with Actons collection at the poor widow’s next sale. Woodward of the British Museum advises their being sent to London for sale &amp; says the Museum Authorities will attempt to purchase some thing—</p>
