                  <p>I have delayed a few days thanking you for the kind present you have been so good as to send me– &amp; which I dare say will sooner or later prove useful to me– &amp; will always serve as a memorial of your kindness. I received the plate of the Hadleigh Rectory safely &amp; have restored it to the person who had lent it to me.</p>
                  <p>My daughter Fanny is now much better, &amp; the inconveniences she was suffering from the fall seems to be entirely leaving her– She bids me give you her very kind regards &amp; best thanks for the letters you forwarded to her– Indeed I am much gratified by all Josephs letters– The only confirm me mine &amp; secure in the good opinion I had formed of him– &amp; prove the zealous nature of his character in a way which must, <del>in</del> all <del>human probability</del>, satisfy everyone that in all human probability his future success is certain– I have busied myself lately in taking Wasps &amp; Hornets nests for Sir W <hi rend="superscript">m.</hi> H's Museum– &amp; have got some fine specimens now under process of drying &amp; preparation– I am glad to hear that the accounts from Irstead are somewhat better today &amp; hope &amp; trust that it will please God to restore Miss Hooker to her health before long– Our Curator M <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray at Cambridge jumped at the idea of obtaining Maritime plants from Yarmouth, &amp; as I am going to Cambridge tomorrow for a couple of days I shall have some talk with him on the subject.–</p>
