                  <p>On Wednesday week I have a firework party to please the young ones &amp; shall be employed all day in preparations. On either Monday, Tuesday, Thursday or Friday I am at your service &amp; weather permitting should like to catch the Daguerreotype of you if possible but that must be between 11 &amp; 2 o clk &amp; I must show before hand that I may have the Plates ready. For our Natural History Amusements? any time will suit and a Family dinner &amp; a Bed await your service if such arrangements are convenient to you.</p>
                  <p>I am very much obliged by all the trouble you have taken about the Beaver remains &amp; should like much to have them[.] By some blunder I have mislaid your first letter &amp; M <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Decks, that is if I have not sent M <hi rend="superscript">r </hi> Decks to Cambridge to him but of this I am not certain as I have been overwhelmed with letter writing of late.</p>
                  <p>Your letters both reached me after much travelling about &amp; the Turtle has also safely reached Owens hands &amp; shall be taken every care of &amp; safely ret <hi rend="superscript">d</hi> in due course.</p>
                  <p>with renewed thanks for the trouble you have taken for me</p>

                  <p>P.S. Do not take further trouble about the Beaver[.] I will write Mr Deck to send them me tomorrow—</p>
