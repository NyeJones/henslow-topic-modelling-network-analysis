                  <p>I am much obliged by your note &amp; its enclosures and am glad to hear that your lecture went off in so satisfactorily a manner[.] I wish I could have been myself among your audience— I shall keep your prospectus or rather programme for reference as I do not know of any other list of paper producing plants so complete as yours— I am quite ready to condole with you on your want of proper diagram paper, and if you will inform me, of what width you would like it to be, I will see if we cannot alleviate your distress, by sending you a roll which will meet your future requirements.</p>
                  <p>I have had one very fine British coin presented to me since I had the pleasure of shewing you my collection, of gold &amp; inscribed AND. who many possibly have been the (M)andubratius of Caesar—I have also acquired some interesting Jewish coins including some of Jonathan, John Hyrcanus &amp; Alexander Jannaeus—I hope you will succeed to your satisfaction with the tessellated pavement— They are very troublesome to restore or repair— I have given M <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Longman one of your programmes &amp; he had desired me to convey to you his thanks for it—M <hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Evans desires to be kindly remembered to you &amp; I remain</p>
                  <p>My dear Sir | yours very truly | John Evans</p>
