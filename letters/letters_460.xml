                  <p>If there were any doubt about the matter, the Hitcham Easter sheet you have been so good as to send me, would at once prove that Prof. <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell was quite right when he called yours a model parish, for how few could show such a numerous list of beneficent institutions, in addition to your legion cultural horticultural &amp; Botanical ones, &amp; scarcely one I fear a “Recreation fund”. This happy mixture of recreation with sciences, &amp; the whole carried out by your own zealous affects, I have always regarded as a feature of your parish peculiar to it &amp; which may well be offered to all your Clerical brothers as a pattern that cannot be too closely followed in theirs, &amp; I rely on you informing me when the time comes what your excursion plans are, that I may have the pleasure of offering my aid. Your decision to decline accepting the Norwich invitation was I think right, but it would be most desirable that at Norwich, Ipswich, Harwich &amp;c the friends of this harmonizing plan of giving in Summer a day’s happiness to the Hitcham children, would provide them with refreshment of tea &amp; cakes, as their contribution towards the far greater share of the trouble &amp; expense taken by yourself.</p>
                  <p>I am | my dear Sir | yours very truly | W. Spence</p>
